{"title": "SerDes Circuit Design Engineer", "summary": "In this role, you will actively work within Analog-Mixed/Signal design team and participate in bring-up of embedded circuits; collaborating with many disciplines to enable the world\u2019s premiere products. You will closely work with a talented group of Analog-Mixed/Signal designers working diligently to deliver hard IPs to Apple\u2019s products while exceeding the highest expectations of quality, innovation and efficiency.", "description": "We have ownership AMS circuits used in SerDes PHY, including evaluation of different circuit topologies for specific product requirements (e.g., Rx, CDR, Tx, bias generator, clock generation and distribution, etc.) You will be working with multi-functional teams to define requirements/specs (e.g., modeling, package, board, DFT, ESD, etc.), crafting block-level specifications based on link-budget, behavioral modeling, and transistor-level feasibility. You will also drive mask design to implement layout view of designs. We also are working on Generation/QA of various IP Kit views/files for release to IP consumers, defining production/bench-level testplans, and conducting design reviews of blocks with peers/management to show design meets spec targets and requirements.", "key_qualifications": "The ideal candidate should have deep understanding of analog mixed-signal design with experience in high-speed serial links. Solid understanding and experience of designing analog mixed signal circuit blocks including Bandgap, biasing circuits, LDO regulators, amplifiers, comparators, switched-cap circuits, ADCs, DACs, Oscillators, Filters. In-depth knowledge of analog mixed-signal concepts like mismatch mitigation, linearity, stability, low-power and low-noise techniques...", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "BSEE with 10+ years of proven experience.
