Implement system models for the wireless communication system and its RF/circuit impairments and design, simulate, and implement state-of-the-art physical layer wireless communication algorithms. Design algorithms for calibration, pre-equalization, cancellation, and/or pre-distortion techniques to achieve efficient and robust performance across a large number of parts, systems, and wireless channels. Implement fixed-point models and perform detailed performance investigation to allow performance sign-off and enable RTL bit-exact development. Design PHY algorithms with digital designers using power and area efficient digital implementations. Design PHY methods with firmware designers using high efficiency software implementations, and hardware acceleration. Validate and characterize algorithms on real silicon alongside RFIC and digital circuit designers and automation/test engineers. Bring-up and take to production state-of-the-art physical layer wireless communication system algorithms for very high data rate applications. Design firmware based algorithms involving MAC-PHY interactions and SW based PHY configurations and implement codes in Python and in firmware. Develop test plans and work with automation/test engineers to implement the same, collect and analyze test result, identify and debug issues.", "key_qualifications": "Proven experience in system design, integration, bringing up and productization of wireless communication systems.
