These units include Load-Store unit, different levels of caches, bus interface units, memory controller, etc. \u2022 Develop verification environment which can be used in both simulation and emulation \u2022 Develop synthesizable transactors and test benches and support verification hooks for verifying memory subsystem functionality and CPU/SOC features \u2022 Develop unit level stimulus as well as full chip assembly programs to verify memory subsystem \u2022 Develop verification IPs \u2022 Work closely with the CPU, SOC, and GPU RTL design teams and understand the specification in detail for developing verification strategy for the above mentioned environment taking system level considerations into account \u2022 Develop coverage monitors and accomplish coverage goals \u2022 Debug failures in both pre and post silicon environments, root-cause problems, and propose design changes to address issues \u2022 Develop abstract end-to-end checks to verify CPU-SOC memory subsystem interaction and coherence protocols \u2022 Use novel techniques such as formal verification, emulation/FPGA technology, as well as industry standard tools and languages to verify memory subsystem", "key_qualifications": "Minimum BS and 3+ years of relevant industry experience. Experience with digital logic design, CPU and SOC architecture/micro-architecture and memory subsystem is preferred. Strong programming (C/C++, Verilog, Scripting), software optimization, and performance improvement skills. Experience in unit and full chip level test benches. Experience in developing testplans, assertions, and developing stimulus. Should be a great teammate with excellent communication skills and be able to work independently on the verification efforts for a block/area of the design. Experience with emulation and developing synthesizable transactors is a plus", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "Minimum BS and 3+ years of relevant industry experience", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "", "company": "apple", "url": "https://jobs.apple.com/en-in/details/200451432"}
