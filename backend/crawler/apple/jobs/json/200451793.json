{"title": "Design Verification Engineer", "summary": "Do you have a passion for invention and self-challenge? Do you thrive on pushing the limits of what\u2019s considered feasible? As part of our team, you will be responsible for and contribute to verifying high-throughput, complex cellular baseband modems and transceiver link controllers: You will be crafting highly reusable premier UVM test benches, implementing coverage driven and directed test cases working with cross functional teams, deploying new tools and methodologies to improve quality of tape-out readiness. By collaborating with other product development groups across Apple, you\u2019ll push the industry boundaries of what cellular systems can do and improve the product experience for our customers across the world! You will be able to learn different aspects of cellular protocol, different complex IPs and Sub-system architectures, different fabric protocols and architecture, best in class DV methodology, co-verification with models and FW, industry standard low-power architecture and complex debug architectures, etc. You will have a dedicated/hands-on ASIC DV experience in reusable verification methodology such as UVM or OVM. As a Design Verification Engineer in our team, you are at the center of the verification effort within our silicon design group! You will be designing and productizing state-of-the-art cellular baseband modems and RF link controllers targeted for SOCs. You are responsible for high quality verification of different complex IPs and Sub-System designs by working closely with cross-functional teams. You are expected to adapt to evolving requirements, do detail test planning, and develop re-usable verification environments to achieve quality goals.", "description": "Once you understand the details of design components and any associated system reference models. You will construct a detailed test plan for various components of the design, including use cases, through collaborative work with cross-functional teams. You will create coverage-driven verification plans from specifications, review with multi-functional teams, and refine to achieve coverage targets. Architect UVM-based, reusable test benches with components for stimulus, checkers, VIPs, and reference models. Work closely with DV methodology architects to improve verification flow. Execute the test plan from RTL simulation bring-up to sign-off, report and debug failures, maintain regressions, report verification progress against test plan and coverage metrics.", "key_qualifications": "BS and 3+ years of relevant industry experience. Strong knowledge of System Verilog and UVM. Good understanding of System C, C/C++, Python/perl. Experience in developing and establishing DV Methodologies. Ability to develop System Verilog Testbench with UVM methodology from scratch. Experience in C/C++ modeling for design verification is a plus. Experience with constraint random testing, SVA, Coverage driven verification. Good test planning and problem-solving skills. Knowledge of 4G/5G cellular physical layer operation (3GPP) is a plus. Experience with verification of embedded processor cores. Hands-on verification experience of Bus Fabric, NOC, AHB, AXI, based bus architecture in UVM environment. Should be a standout colleague with excellent communication and analytic skills with the desire to take on diverse challenges.", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "BS and 3+ years of relevant industry experience.", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range.
