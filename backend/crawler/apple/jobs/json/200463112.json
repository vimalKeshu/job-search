{"title": "SerDes Circuit Design Engineer", "summary": "We are seeking experienced Analog Mixed-Signal designers to join our high-speed SerDes team. Our team specializes in building next generation high-performance wireline transceivers delivering intellectual-property (IP) for Apple\u2019s world-leading system-on-chip (SOC)! In this role, you will actively work with cross-functional Analog Mixed-Signal design teams to create state-of-the-art IPs key to Apple\u2019s products. You will be challenged to make the best-in-class designs to surprise and delight Apple customers. With transforming the user experience in focus, you will get an opportunity to work on designs which makes the best systems. This enables you to learn to end-to-end system while exceeding the highest expectations of quality, innovation and efficiency. If you have strong fundamentals and a track record of tackling technical challenges, If you are passionate about learning new skills and improving the value of your work, If you like to be tuned to the bigger-picture while diving deeply into the details to innovate and solve problems, We invite you to join and grow with our team!", "description": "We work on the development of high-performance and high-speed AMS circuits used in SerDes PHY, including evaluation of different circuit topologies for specific product requirements (e.g., Rx, CDR, Tx, bias generator, high-speed clock generation and low-jitter distribution, phase interpolator, DLL, VCO, LDO) with best in class power, performance, and area (PPA). We lead discussions with multi-functional teams (e.g., architecture, SIPI, packaging, board design, DFT, ESD) to create and drive block-level specifications, mixed-signal implementations and behavioral modeling. We work closely with SOC teams to deliver IP views and ensure they meet the quality standards. While developing these complex IPs on regular basis, we interact with peers/management to communicate progress, discuss new ideas and drive new implementations/concepts making it an exciting and growth-oriented work environment.", "key_qualifications": "", "preferred_qualifications": "The ideal candidate should have deep understanding of AMS design with experience in high-speed serial links.
