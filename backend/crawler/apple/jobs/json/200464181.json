{"title": "CPU Architecture Opportunities at Apple", "summary": "Do you have an uncommon desire to seek out and solve exceedingly difficult challenges rather than the easy ones? Do you grow with adversity? Do you believe that truly valuable and meaningful accomplishments are the result of pushing the limits of perseverance? Do you believe that a world-class team with relentless drive can surpass even their own high expectations? We do! But we also realize this job isn\u2019t for everyone. What we do isn\u2019t easy but you don\u2019t take the easy path. Apple is seeking a highly motivated and ambitious engineers to join our group that is driving advanced exploration for next generation iPhone, iPad, and Mac CPU architectures.", "description": "Below are the various areas you can explore within CPU Platform Architecture:\n\nCPU Core Architecture:\nWe focus on solving hard problems in the area of CPU Performance and Architecture to improve user experience on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. We pursue advanced micro-architecture ideas for improving performance of CPU pipeline, branch predictors, code and data prefetchers, load/store unit and several other related areas. These improvements are made through close collaboration with our software partners on iOS and macOS to deliver the most optimal overall performance solution. We rely on strong analytical skills to identify performance bottlenecks on relevant workloads, craft ideas to solve them and implement those ideas in the performance simulator. The group conducts continuous research in focused CPU areas and provides guidance to Apple CPU design team on features that should be implemented in future CPUs. The life cycle from conception of idea to feasible implementation is achieved through close collaboration with CPU design teams.\n\nCPU Memory Subsystem Exploration:\nThis group focuses on advancements to the performance, power, and area-efficiency of the CPU cache and memory subsystem. Research is conducted into future memory latency tolerance techniques, development of next-generation data prefetchers, CPU caching topologies and policies, vector/matrix acceleration, and SoC architectures supportive of CPU performance. Exploration is aided by performance model development, data analysis, and novel AI/ML techniques. Roles in this group also require close collaboration with CPU design teams to see ideas through from ideation to feasible implementation.\n\nCPU Simulation Environment:\nThe engineers in this group push forward the tools and methodologies used for performance exploration, bottleneck identification, and insight discovery. From the CPU simulator to visualization tools, innovations in productivity boost the output of the entire team. Areas of work include C++ and Python software engineering, CPU simulation methodologies, execution-driven model development, data analysis and visualization tool development, leadership in CI/CD, runtime optimization, AI/ML model development for architectural exploration, and more.\n\nCPU Performance & Workload Analysis:\nWe focus on identifying and analyzing the workloads that matter to our users on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. Using performance analysis capabilities architected into our hardware, the team works on gaining insights into workloads to provide feedback to software teams to help optimize software for our CPU cores. The team also uses custom hardware to capture traces that enable the exploration teams to simulate future micro-architectures on our performance simulator.\n\nThe group also develops in-depth performance analysis tools to provide deeper insights into the workloads we analyze.", "key_qualifications": "Some of the relevant degrees include: Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or related degrees\nExtensive knowledge of CPU Architecture", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "", "company": "apple", "url": "https://jobs.apple.com/en-in/details/200464181"}
