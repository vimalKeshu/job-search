{"title": "Sr. RFIC Layout Engineer", "summary": "The Wireless SoC Radio Team designs state-of-art highly energy efficient CMOS radios, from RF to bits. In this role, you will work closely with the RFIC design team to layout and verify custom RF and analog IP for complex SoC products.", "description": "As a RF IC Layout Engineer, you will be a key member of a small RFIC team, researching, designing and bringing the next-generation of wireless technologies into high-volume production in advanced CMOS technology nodes. Responsibilities include: detailed transistor-level layout of RF and analog circuit blocks including LNA, mixers, PLL, LO generation, modulators, power amplifiers, ADC/DAC, baseband filters, and bandgap/bias/LDO. Block level and top-level layout through full verification flow including extraction, DRC, LVS, and DFM checking. Co-work with designers on block level and top-level floorplanning. Layout review for power/gnd routing, electromigration, signal path check, differential, and IQ matching, and signal coupling. Top-level layout integration and verification, schedule management.", "key_qualifications": "BS and 10+ years of relevant industry experience. Experience in custom RF/analog layout for radio transceivers with extensive knowledge of deep sub-micron CMOS (FinFet experience is a must). Knowledgeable in layout techniques for device matching, minimizing parasitics, RF shielding, and high frequency routing. Solid understanding of RC delay, electromigration, and coupling. Understanding of guard rings, DNW, PN junctions, and advanced process effects such as LOD, WPE, etc. High level proficiency in interpretation of CALIBRE DRC, ERC, LVS, etc. in FinFet Technology. Knowledge of CADENCE layout tools. Excellent communication skills and able to work with cross-functional teams. Capability to lead other layout engineers for top-level integration. Ability to recognize failure prone circuit and layout structures and proactively work with circuit designers for the best approach to resolve problems. Scripting skills in PERL or SKILL are a plus, but not required.", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "BS and 10+ years of relevant industry experience.", "additional_requirements": "Apple is an equal opportunity employer that is committed to inclusion and diversity.
