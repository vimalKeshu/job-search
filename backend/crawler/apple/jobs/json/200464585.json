{"title": "Signal Integrity - RF Integrity Validation Engineer", "summary": "Our RFI (RF Integrity) team develops novel methodologies to tackle coupling, spur, and coexistence issues in highly coordinated RF systems through simulation and lab debug. The engineering regime covers Silicon, package, module, PCB, and form-factor device. The working methods are constantly evolving and blurring boundaries of existing domains. As an RF Integrity Validation Engineer, you will address the isolation, shielding, coexistence, and space-saving challenges at chip, package, module, and system level through lab experiments. The team is small and the coverage is huge due to its multidiscipline nature. You will explore multiple aspects of RF technology and expand the boundary of innovation. If you like self-challenge and can thrive in an innovative and fast-pacing work environment, you might be the engineer we are looking for.", "description": "Collaborate with RFIC, Package, and product teams to debug chip or board level crosstalk/EMI/desense issues in RF system. Define/implement validation plans for RF transmitters/receivers. Use EM/RF knowledge, hands-on prototyping, and measurement to understand sophisticated sub-system interactions, implications to product level design, and manufacturing trade-offs. Develop test automation programs on different FW/SW platforms. Explore the testability of multi-radio coexistence/emission/desense in form-factor.", "key_qualifications": "-  Bachelors of Science degree and 3+ years of confirmed experience.\n-  Excellent problem-solving and skills in a dynamic and complex environment when the boundary is not clearly defined.\n-  Passion for learning new technology and willingness to do things differently to address problems.\n-  Broad experience with RF lab debug and characterization.
