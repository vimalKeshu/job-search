{"title": "AMS SerDes Circuit Design Engineer", "summary": "In this role, you will actively work within Analog-Mixed/Signal design team and participate in bring-up of embedded circuits; collaborating with many disciplines to enable the world\u2019s premiere products.", "description": "We have ownership AMS circuits used in SerDes PHY, including evaluation of different circuit topologies for specific product requirements (e.g., Rx, CDR, Tx, bias generator, clock generation and distribution, etc.) You will be working with multi-functional teams to define requirements/specs (e.g., modeling, package, board, DFT, ESD, etc.), crafting block-level specifications based on link-budget, behavioral modeling, and transistor-level feasibility. You will also drive mask design to implement layout view of designs. We also are working on Generation/QA of various IP Kit views/files for release to IP consumers, defining production/bench-level test plans, and conducting design reviews of blocks with peers/management to show design meets spec targets and requirements.", "key_qualifications": "The ideal candidate should have deep understanding of analog mixed-signal design with experience in high-speed serial links. Solid understanding and experience of designing analog mixed signal circuit blocks including Bandgap, biasing circuits, LDO regulators, amplifiers, comparators, switched-cap circuits, ADCs, DACs, Oscillators, Filters In-depth knowledge of analog mixed-signal concepts like mismatch mitigation, linearity, stability, low-power and low-noise techniques Experience with Tx/Rx equalization techniques and circuits like de-emphasis, CTLE, DFE Experience with high speed digital circuits (e.g., serializer, deserializer, counters, dividers, etc.) Familiarity with CDR architectures and implementations Design experience in advanced CMOS technologies, design with FinFet technology Hands-on experience with AMS IC development from definition to high-volume production including layout supervision, bench evaluation, correlation, and characterization Experience in lab testing of high-speed serial links Knowledge of common high-speed SerDes protocols (e.g., PCIe, USB, SATA, etc.) EXPERIENCE IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS IS DESIRABLE: Static timing analysis tools (e.g., Nanotime, Primetime, etc.) Modeling of digitally assisted analog adaptive loops (using C, Matlab or Python, etc.) Able to build VerilogA/AMS behavioral models Able to analyze and lead characterization data from lab and volume testing Knowledge of ESD requirements", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "BSEE with 3+ years of proven experience.", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "", "company": "apple", "url": "https://jobs.apple.com/en-in/details/200485718"}
