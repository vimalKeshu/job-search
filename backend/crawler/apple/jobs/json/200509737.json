{"title": "Machine Learning Engineer, SIML", "summary": "We work on the cutting edge of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning to build intelligent system experiences for the world\u2019s most impactful platforms such as iOS, macOS, tvOS, etc. This system-wide intelligence aims to provide best-in-class solutions for problems that are critical to the success of 1st and 3rd party applications in Apple platforms.", "description": "As a ML engineer in the SIML HOUr team, you will work with large-language models and multi-modal generative models, following closely groundbreaking advancements in this domain, to adjust and apply them to internal use cases. One main mission of the role is building adapters on top of large models to enable specific use cases, having a direct impact on features across the Apple ecosystem. The work will involve translating high-level product goals into different levels of the stack. From defining the data needs, manipulating data, fine-tuning pre-trained models for the task, evaluating it across relevant metrics and power and performance, prototyping and delivering it for integration. The work will be multi-functional, collaborating with ML researchers, software engineers, product design, and other teams. Be expected to iterate quickly to deliver a high quality model, that is performant, reliable, tested extensively, and documented. Apart from model development, the role will also give the experience of scoping projects, estimating timelines, multi-functional planning and presenting your work to organization leadership. If this could be of interest, please apply!", "key_qualifications": "Familiarity with Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hold yourself and others to a high bar when delivering a model, Have great communication skills, for collaborating across many participating teams, Hands-on experience with LLM-based workflows: prompt engineering and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained LLM, Experience with multi-modal setting, specifically Vision and Language, Ability to rapidly iterate with fine-tuning toolboxes, Ability to translate high-level product goals into data, model and metrics requirements, Awareness and attention to model complexity, power and performance.", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "Master's or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or a related field", "additional_requirements": "Apple\u2019s most important resource, our soul, is our people.
