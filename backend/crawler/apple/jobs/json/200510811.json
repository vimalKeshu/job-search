{"title": "Baseband Hardware Design Engineer", "summary": "We live in a mobile and device driven world where knowledge of the physical world around us is needed. We rely on this knowledge to get around, to learn about our environment and to enable spectacular new features for custom applications. Apple is meeting those needs as robustly and as creatively as possible and is interested in people who want to help meet that commitment. The success we are striving will be the result of very skilled people working in an environment which cultivates creativity, partnership, and thinking of old problems in new ways. If that sounds like the kind of environment that you find intriguing, then let's talk. These elements come together to make Apple an amazing environment for motivated people to do the greatest work of their lives. You will become part of a team that sets the standard in cultivating excellence, creativity and innovation. Will you help us design the next generation of revolutionary Apple products?", "description": "This is an EE (a.k.a baseband HW) position in the Hardware Technology group of Apple and it is one of the most diverse roles out there! This team is responsible for the digital and power management domain of all wireless chipset in Apple products from concept to product announcement. During architectural stage you will work with world-class architects and IC designers on next-gen chipset\u2019s Power/Digital/Clock management. During development, you will drive schematics/layout/bring-up of both development and form factor HW. You will debug HW/SW/Co-existence issue that are often seen only by the scale and volume of an Apple product. You will also have the full weight of the world\u2019s leading contract manufacturer behind you in factory prototype support. This role also requires heavy cross-functional collaboration with other teams (Apple SoC, battery, sensors, iOS\u2026etc) and therefore, you will also maintain a firm grasp of the entire product landscape outside of wireless design.", "key_qualifications": "BSEE and 3+ years of relevant industry experience, Strong electrical engineering fundamentals, Experience with schematic capture, layout design and review, Experience with mobile platform system design, system integration and/or high-volume consumer electronics design, Experience with voltage regulators, LDO, switch mode power supplies (SMPS) preferred, Experience with high-speed and low-speed digital interfaces, e.g. PCIe, SPMI, I2C, UART etc preferred, Bench-level design verification experience with high-speed oscilloscopes preferred, Signal/Power integrity simulation experience with Matlab, PowerSI, SIwave, HFSS, etc. preferred, Strong problem solving and analytical skills, Position may require some international travel", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "BS and 3+ years of relevant industry experience", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "", "company": "apple", "url": "https://jobs.apple.com/en-in/details/200510811"}
