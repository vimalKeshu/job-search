{"title": "RFIC Design Engineer", "summary": "Would you like to join Apple\u2019s growing wireless silicon development team? The wireless RFIC team architects, designs, and validates radio transceivers integrated into complex wireless SoCs. Our wireless organization is responsible for all aspects of wireless silicon development that transform the user experience at the product level, all of which is driven by a best-in-class vertically integrated engineering team spanning RF/Analog architecture and design, Systems/PHY/MAC architecture and design, VLSI/RTL design, and integration, Emulation, Design Verification, Test and Validation, and FW/SW engineering.", "description": "As RFIC Design Engineer, you are going to be responsible for providing RFIC designs for wireless SoC and driving them to mass production for Apple\u2019s Wireless Connectivity products. Responsibilities include: - Hands-on design contributions starting from concept, architecture and topology to transistor-level feasibility studies, power, area, and performance trade-off analysis to actual design, simulations, and extractions. - Design and delivery of radio transceiver building blocks and chains including TX, RX, and PLL-LOGen for wireless connectivity products. - Work closely with RF Systems in block level and high level specifications of the TX, and RX line ups and PLL-LOGen, and proper distribution of spec margins in the chain. - Design of RF and Analog loopbacks for calibration and compensation. - Work through Co-Existence scenarios and design to meet the CoEx requirements. - Oversee the floorplan layout and verification of the design to ensure a successful tape-out. - Close collaboration with RFIC test engineers in the bring up, debug and optimization of the wireless connectivity chip through the productization. - Provide design versus silicon measurements correlation, and compliance with specification for a volume production.", "key_qualifications": "RF/analog and mixed signal design experience in cutting-edge RF CMOS design. Deep experience in designing and bringing into mass production of wireless transceivers is a plus. Deep understanding of analog, mixed-signal and RF circuit design. This includes design of LNAs, and PAs, PLL/VCO/DCO/LOGEN blocks, mixers, baseband filters and amplifiers, data converters and calibration methods associated with such high performance wireless systems. Deep understanding of analog design concepts such as analysis of noise, linearity, mismatch, stability, and other analog impairments. Familiarity with various RF transceiver architectures and their trade-offs, system specifications and ability to work with system architects to translate system requirements into circuit requirements at IC level.", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "BS and 3+ years of relevant industry experience.
