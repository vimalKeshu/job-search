{"title": "SoC Cache Architecture Performance Modeling Engineer, Platform Architecture", "summary": "Do you love crafting elegant solutions to complex problems? Do you enjoy learning how systems work from the big picture down to the smallest detail? As part of the SoC Performance group, you\u2019ll work with a diverse set of cross-functional teams to help architect, optimize, and ship our industry-leading SoCs powering Apple products from iPhone to Apple Watch, iPad, Macs, and more! You\u2019ll join a team of performance architects who deeply analyze the way our SoCs are used by real software, in order to ensure that software can harness the full power of our chips and to drive the design of future SoCs to be an even better match for real-world use cases. We\u2019re looking for experienced, passionate, and highly motivated individuals to help us set the standard on the performance, efficiency, and hardware/software integration of Apple\u2019s products! You will enjoy this role if: -  You're interested in hardware design, hardware/software co-design, hardware/software optimization, and power/performance tradeoffs. -  You derive satisfaction from not only performing the analysis, but using your interpersonal skills to use your analysis to influence the direction of the organization. -  You enjoy doing deep-dives into hardware and software parts that are outside of your immediate area of responsibility, to establish relationships across the organization and apply the findings to innovate the parts you own.", "description": "As a SoC Cache Architecture Performance Modeling Engineer, you will collaborate with engineers across the organization to model and improve the hardware and low-level software architecture of our chips by using a high-performance C++ simulator. You will be involved with the full life-cycle of performance modeling, from early architectural exploration to post-silicon correlation. The role requires deep expertise in the architecture and design of SoC caches, how they are used by the different SoC components such as CPU, GPU, Display, Camera, Machine Learning, and how they interact with the other parts of the memory system. It also requires appreciating the good parts of C++, and using the language to enhance the utility of our simulation models.", "key_qualifications": "Ideally, you will have a B.S. and 3+ years of relevant industry experience and posses: - Good written and verbal communication skills. - Deep understanding of cache micro-architecture, data coherency protocols, and on-chip interconnect architecture. - Good knowledge of C++, including templates and the STL. - Experience in writing and using SoC performance models, and transforming the simulation results into compelling performance analysis. - Ability and enthusiasm to work with experts in other domains, such as CPU, GPU, Display, Camera, and Machine Learning, to understand their cache usage requirements, and help them apply good performance modeling practices to drive architecture and design decisions. - Proficiency in scripting languages, ideally Python.", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "B.S. and 3+ years of relevant industry experience. Masters, or PhD in EE, CS, or related field preferred", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range. This provides the opportunity to progress as you grow and develop within a role. The base pay range for this role is between $143,100 and $264,200, and your base pay will depend on your skills, qualifications, experience, and location. Apple employees also have the opportunity to become an Apple shareholder through participation in Apple\u2019s discretionary employee stock programs. Apple employees are eligible for discretionary restricted stock unit awards, and can purchase Apple stock at a discount if voluntarily participating in Apple\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. You\u2019ll also receive benefits including: Comprehensive medical and dental coverage, retirement benefits, a range of discounted products and free services, and for formal education related to advancing your career at Apple, reimbursement for certain educational expenses \u2014 including tuition. Additionally, this role might be eligible for discretionary bonuses or commission payments as well as relocation. Learn more about Apple Benefits.
