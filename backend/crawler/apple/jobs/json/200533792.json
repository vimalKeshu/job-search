{"title": "Senior Media Performance Architect - Platform Architecture", "summary": "Do you love crafting elegant solutions to highly complex challenges? Are you a big-picture forward-thinking who understands how each element affects all the others? At Apple, our Architecture group is responsible for connecting our hardware and software into one unified system. Join this team, and you\u2019ll collaborate with engineers across Apple to design how all our technologies work in unison! We are looking for an experienced media performance architect to join our dynamic team. We own the performance models of several of the complex multi-media IPs in Apple\u2019s SoCs. These IPs are central to the customer experience in almost all of Apple\u2019s products from Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, MacBook, to next-generation product lines. In this highly visible role, you will collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to develop, verify, and use performance models for data-driven architectural exploration and validation.", "description": "As a media-IP SoC performance architect, you will have responsibilities spanning all aspects of performance model development: planning model architecture, implementation, validation, performance studies, and RTL correlation. \u2022 Collaborate with system architecture and IP design teams to plan, implement, and validate a high-level performance model in C++. The performance model is minimal feature set to meet the model accuracy requirements yet modular and flexible enough to be adapted for new projects and architectural exploration. \u2022Developing, analyzing, and presenting results of performance studies for different architectural and micro-architectural proposals from within the team as well as other architecture and design teams. \u2022Develop custom tools for analyzing simulation results of these complex architectures to provide new insights into their behavior and propose innovative architectural changes to improve the performance. \u2022Presenting performance study results to design teams and other architecture teams. \u2022Validating the performance model against the specification and correlating the model with RTL.", "key_qualifications": "Strong understanding of SoC, fabric, and memory system architectures\nStrong software development and organizational skills especially with modular object-oriented SW architectures in C++\nProficiency in scripting languages such as Python & shell scripting\nSoC architecture and micro-architectural knowledge, especially with regards to performance analysis\nExperience with performance model development & analysis\nLooking for people who are fast learners with strong problem solving and analytical skills\nExcellent written and verbal communication skills for cross-functional collaboration and presentations\nEducation: MS/PhD in EE/CS/CE\n5+ years of experience in performance modeling and architecture", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "", "company": "apple", "url": "https://jobs.apple.com/en-in/details/200533792"}
