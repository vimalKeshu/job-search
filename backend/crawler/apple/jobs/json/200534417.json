{"title": "Senior Wireless System Engineer \u2013 DSP for Radio systems", "summary": "At Apple, we work every single day to craft products that enrich people\u2019s lives. Do you love working on challenges that no one has solved yet? Do you like changing the game? We have an opportunity for a forward-thinking and unusually hardworking Wireless System Engineer. As a member of our dynamic group, you will have the rare and extraordinary opportunity to craft upcoming products that will delight and encourage millions of Apple\u2019s customers every single day. In this technical role, you will be at the center of a silicon design group, responsible for using digital algorithm or method to improve the RF/analog performances of innovative wireless communication SoC products. You will be involved in developing systems model of RF/analog designs, evaluating associated impairments, and investigate innovative designs for performance enhancements of novel digitally aided radio architecture enhancements. This includes: calibration for radio circuits characteristics matching and signal quality controls such as crest-factor-reduction (CFR), digital predistortion (DPD) for power-amplifier, beamforming for nonlinearities or interference nulling and digital cancellations of linear or nonlinear interference sources. You will work on architecting various calibration and correction methods for implementation in hardware/firmware, and validation of overall performance enhancement through lab measurement. You will collaborate with RF/analog designers, software or firmware engineers, digital designers, product engineers and architects to define and specify parts of the whole wireless systems.", "description": "In this role, core responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following: \u2022Investigate algorithms and processing structures for digitally aided radio/analog system architectures for enhanced performances. \u2022Investigate algorithms to alleviate various RF and analog impairments, and design calibration and correction methods to allow the improved performance. \u2022Design and simulate innovative wireless communication systems for very high data rate applications. \u2022Architect HW/FW/SW partitioning of various calibrations for area and time efficiency. \u2022Implement system models of the analog front-end design, impairments and come up with right controls and calibrations in C and MATLAB for the end-to-end optimal system performances. \u2022Work with digital designers to realize these methods with power and area efficient digital implementations. \u2022Work with firmware designers to realize these methods with high efficiency software implementation, and possibility hardware acceleration. \u2022Bring up, test and characterize real silicon with relevant implementation in lab.", "key_qualifications": "Extensive experience in designing relevant signal processing for wireless communications systems. Proven track record of optimization algorithm and its applications to RF calibration. Good understanding of RF and analog components/modules composited of wireless communication systems, the possible impairments from those components, and the corresponding calibration and impairment reduction methods/algorithms.
