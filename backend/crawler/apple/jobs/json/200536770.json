{"title": "Multimodal Generative Modeling Research Engineer - SIML, ISE", "summary": "Are you excited about Generative AI? Are you interested in working on cutting edge generative modeling technologies to enrich billions of people? We have multiple ongoing efforts involving generative models. We are looking for technical leaders experienced in training, adapting and deploying large scale ML models with a focus on multimodal understanding and generation.", "description": "We are looking for a candidate with a proven track record in applied ML research. Responsibilities in the role will include training large scale multimodal (2D/3D vision-language) models on distributed backends, deployment of compact neural architectures efficiently on device, address growing set of safety challenges to make the model robust and aligned with human values. Ensuring quality in the wild, with an emphasis on model safety, fairness and robustness would constitute a meaningful part of the role. You will be interacting very closely with a variety of ML researchers, software engineers, hardware and design teams cross functionally. The primary responsibilities of the role would center on enriching multimodal capabilities of large language models. The user experience initiative would focus on aligning image/video content to the space of LMs for visual actions & multi-turn interactions.", "key_qualifications": "3+ years of expertise within ML and Generative Modeling fundamentals Experience adapting pre-trained Vision/Language models for downstream tasks & human alignment Modeling experience at the intersection of NLP and vision Familiarity with distributed training Proficiency in using ML toolkits, e.g., PyTorch You're aware of the challenges associated with the transition of a prototype into a final product Proven record of research innovation and demonstrated leadership in both applied research and development", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "M.S. or PhD in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science or a related field (mathematics, physics or computer engineering), with a focus on NLP, computer vision and/or machine learning; or comparable professional experience.", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range.
