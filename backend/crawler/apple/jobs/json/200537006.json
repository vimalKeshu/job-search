{"title": "Senior Analog Layout Engineer", "summary": "Join Apple's Silicon Engineering Group (SEG) and be at the forefront of crafting the next generation of Apple's systems-on-chip (SOCs). Seeking highly skilled Senior Analog Layout Leads to contribute to the evolution of Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuits.", "description": "Senior Layout Engineers/Leads are pivotal in delivering Analog Mixed-Signal IP in a SOC flow. You will collaborate with teams of highly skilled individuals to develop the next generation of world-leading SOCs. Your responsibilities include crafting sophisticated layouts for mixed-signal and analog circuits, reviewing floorplans, and analyzing intricate circuits with circuit designers. You'll run complete sets of design verification tools, plan/schedule work, and coordinate vital layout tradeoffs. Interpretation of LVS, DRC, and ERC reports is key to finding the fastest way to complete the layout, exceeding engineering specifications and expectations.", "key_qualifications": "10+ years of experience in analog/mixed-signal layout design, with a focus on deep submicron CMOS circuits and at least 3+ years in FinFET technologies. Programming/scripting knowledge in SKILL, Perl, TCL, Shell, and/or Python. Familiar with Machine Learning and AI concepts. Proven expertise in implementing analog layout designs, achieving tight matching, low noise, and low power consumption. Must recognize failure-prone circuit and layout structures, have experience with analog and DFM best practices, and be able to identify the best approach to solving problems. High proficiency in custom and standard cell-based floor-planning and hierarchical layout assembly. Technical understanding of IR drop, RC delay, electromigration, self-heating, and coupling capacitance. High proficiency in interpreting physical verification reports (DRC, ERC, LVS, etc.). Experience using Cadence Virtuoso's advanced features (XL, EAD, APR, and Constraint Manager). Excellent communication skills and ability to work with cross-functional teams. Additional skills: Cadence Innovus, CAD Automation experience, PCell creation experience.", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "BSEE, MSEE, CS or equivalent with 10+ years of relevant experience.
