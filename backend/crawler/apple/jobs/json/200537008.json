{"title": "Analog Mixed-Signal SerDes Design Engineer", "summary": "We are seeking dedicated Analog Mixed-Signal designers to join our high-speed SerDes team. Our team specializes in building next generation high-performance wireline transceivers delivering intellectual-property (IP) for Apple\u2019s world-leading system-on-chip (SOC). In this role, you will actively work with cross-functional Analog Mixed-Signal design teams to create and execute on state-of-the-art IPs key to Apple\u2019s products. You will be challenged to make the best-in-class designs to surprise and delight Apple customers. With transforming the user experience in focus, you will get an opportunity to work on designs which makes the best systems. This enables you to learn end-to-end system while exceeding the highest expectations of quality, innovation and efficiency. Do you have strong fundamentals and a track record of tackling technical challenges? If you are passionate about learning new skills and improving the value of your work and if you like to be tuned to the bigger-picture while diving deeply into the details to innovate and tackle problems, we invite you to join and grow with our team!", "description": "The Analog Mixed Signal SerDes Design Engineers work on the development of high-performance and high-speed AMS circuits used in SerDes PHY, including evaluation of different circuit topologies for specific product requirements (e.g., Rx, CDR, Tx, bias generator, high-speed clock generation and low-jitter distribution, phase interpolator, DLL, VCO) with best in class power, performance, and area (PPA). You will have the opportunity collaborate with cross-functional teams (e.g., architecture, SIPI, packaging, board design, DFT, ESD) to create block-level specifications, and execute on transistor-level implementation and behavioral modeling. They drive mask design to implement layout view of designs. As Analog Mixed Signal SerDes Design Engineers, you will also work closely with SOC teams to deliver IP views and make sure they meet the quality standards. While developing these complex IPs, on regular basis you will interact with your peers/management to communicate progress and discuss new ideas making it a lively and interactive work environment!", "key_qualifications": "The ideal candidate should have deep knowledge of analog mixed-signal design with experience in high-speed serial links.
