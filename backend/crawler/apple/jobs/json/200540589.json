{"title": "Cellular System Performance Engineer", "summary": "Do you have a passion for invention and self-challenge? This role is at the center of a silicon design group responsible for crafting and productizing innovative cellular SoCs! As a cellular system performance engineer, you will be responsible for the bringup and validation of end-to-end cellular systems. Join us, and help us innovate new wireless systems technologies that continually outperform the previous iterations! By collaborating with other product development groups across Apple, you\u2019ll push the industry boundaries and improve the product experience for our customers across the world.", "description": "Working on the bringup of the cellular end-to-end system including characterization and optimization of RF and system performance in the lab with an emphasis on 5G-NR. Collaborate with multi-functional teams to validate the data and control flows from the Baseband to RF in terms of the various critical metrics. Measure, prioritize, and analyze important metrics data in the lab, and present them with analytics tools. Conduct pre-silicon emulation-based bringup and validation of the cellular system. And simulation-based validation of the control flows and algorithms. Support and maintain high-quality daily Firmware releases.", "key_qualifications": "Experience in bring up or performance characterization of wireless systems focusing on the PHY and RF layers. Hands-on experience in cellular chipsets is helpful.\nSolid understanding of communication theory and signal processing, AGC, beamforming, Tx power control, mitigation of radio impairments, and calibration algorithms.\nStrong technical background in wireless system physical layer and protocols. Work experience in 5G-NR/LTE/UMTS (3G/2G)/WiFi is a plus.\nKnowledge of RF performance metrics such as EVM, spectral mask, frequency error, power accuracy, etc.\nWorking understanding of multiple 4G/5G signaling, and wireless physical layer test equipment (Keysight/LitePoint/Anritsu/R&S) along with their automation interfaces is nice to have.\nHands-on experience in bring up of RFIC in the lab, ability to efficiently use lab equipment (such as VSA, VSG, spectrum analyzer, signal generator, power meter, etc).\nGood experience with Python, C/C++, Matlab, and efficient analysis and automation scripting.\nKnowledge and understanding of 3GPP specs are desirable.\nExperience with silicon prototyping, emulation systems, and virtual platforms is a plus.\nExperience with analytics platform software (Tableau, Spotfire or similar) a plus.", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "BS and 3+ years of relevant industry experience required\nMS or Ph.D. in CS/EE or equivalent is preferred.", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range.
