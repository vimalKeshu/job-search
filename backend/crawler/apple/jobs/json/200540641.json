{"title": "Display Mechanical Engineer", "summary": "At Apple, great ideas have a way of becoming great products, services, and customer experiences very quickly. We want outstanding engineers to bring passion and dedication to our team! Apple\u2019s Display Technologies group is looking for Mechanical Engineers to design and develop innovative display modules for future products. Here you will create next-generation technologies, processes, and components, and own the integration of them into groundbreaking, mechanically robust display designs with amazing performance.", "description": "Our team wants colleagues with a strong curiosity and understanding of the design and development of consumer electronics or mechanical design fields! - Investigate state-of-the-art mechanical designs and technologies, innovate ways to further improve Apple display performance, and enable strong and compact system designs. - Define the module mechanical architecture based on optical, electrical, mechanical, and other cross-functional requirements. Work with the system team to define the interface to the product including fit, assembly features, and tolerance analyses. Deliver any needed specifications including 3D/2D. - Achieve system goals through mechanical design optimization, prototyping, new material qualification, and manufacturing processes. Audit factories to review the manufacturing and assembly at each step to ensure high yield and high quality. - Define & implement validation plans for ME characteristics of the display modules using scientific & analytical approaches. Drive thorough failure analyses for any issues to reach robust corrective actions. Ensure the specifications are met throughout the supply chain. Communicate validation results to peers and leadership. - Act as a focal point among multiple world-class cross-functional teams and suppliers to identify open issues, drive them to closure, and deliver mechanically robust displays. Support the product throughout the architecture, engineering development, mass-production ramp-up, and launch.", "key_qualifications": "High energy personality with a real passion for learning and attention to detail. Excellent prioritization, cross-functional collaboration, and written & verbal communication. Solid understanding of mechanical engineering fundamentals including properties of materials, solid mechanics, beam statics, Newtonian physics, and thermodynamics. The ability to perform mechanical design & validation, including the development of component or material evaluation tests, and failure analysis. 3D/2D software expertise: 3D modeling (Pro/E, NX, CATIA, or Solidworks), engineering drawings, Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T). Exposure to diverse manufacturing techniques such as injection-molding, sheet-metal stamping, 3D printing, and materials such as polymers, glass, and metals. Good understanding of DFA/DFM, and statistical tolerance analysis. Applied Design of Experiments (DOE) and scientific method to address engineering issues. Willingness and ability to travel internationally (~15%, primarily Asia).", "preferred_qualifications": "Experience with simulation and analysis such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for structural and thermal, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is ideal.
