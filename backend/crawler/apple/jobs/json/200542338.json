As part of our Hardware Technologies group, you\u2019ll help design our next-generation, high-performance, power-efficient system-on-chips (SoCs). You will ensure Apple products and services can seamlessly and efficiently handle the tasks that make them beloved by millions! Joining this group means you\u2019ll be responsible for crafting and building the technology that fuels Apple\u2019s devices. Together, we will enable our customers to do all the things they love with their devices! In this highly transparent role, you will be at the center of the Pixel IP design effort to gather and display beautiful images and video. You will collaborate with all fields, making a critical impact getting functional products to millions of customers quickly.", "description": "As an ASIC Design Engineer in the Pixel IP design team, you will work closely with many multi-functional teams (chip integration, physical design, power, logic design, and verification) to build commitment and low power pixel processing engines. Your expertise in integrating large systems-on-a-chip, low-power design techniques, and front-end implementation will enable the team to deliver dedication and low power pixel processing engines on time. In this front-end design role, your tasks will include: -  Integrate large pixel-processing subsystems using SystemVerilog, connecting to high-performance on-chip networks using virtual memory addressing, adding Design-For-Test (DFT) logic, and managing clocks, resets, and power domains. -  Performing front-end implementation, including logic synthesis, clock & reset domain-crossing checks, static timing analysis, power analysis, logic equivalence checking. -  Working with Physical Design teams for physical floor planning and timing closure. -  Collaborating with multi-functional teams to explore solutions that improve performance while minimizing power and area. -  Working closely with design verification and formal verification teams to debug and verify functionality and performance.", "key_qualifications": "Experience in IP/SoC front-end ASIC RTL digital logic design using Verilog and System Verilog. Industry exposure to and knowledge of ASIC/FPGA design methodology, especially logic synthesis, static timing analysis, logic equivalence checking, and working with physical design teams for floorplanning and timing closure. Experience with system design methodologies that contain multiple clock domains. Experience in low-power design issues, tools, and methodologies including UPF power intent specification effective. Familiarity with common on-chip bus protocols such as AMBA (AXI, AHB, APB). Industry exposure to and knowledge of ASIC/FPGA design methodology including familiarity with relevant scripting languages (Python, Perl, TCL). Good collaboration skills with strong written and verbal communication skills. Experience working multi-functionally with integration, design, and verification teams to specify, design, and debug digital systems", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "Bachelor's Degree + 3 Years of Experience", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range.
