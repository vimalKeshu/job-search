{"title": "AIML - Machine Learning SW/HW Co-Design Engineer, Machine Learning Platform & Infrastructure", "summary": "Machine Learning and Platforms (MLPT) team is in Apple\u2019s AIML Org. MLPT's On-device machine learning (ML) team builds the inference stack that runs all ML networks on Apple Silicon. In this team, we write the converter and compiler that translate a source network definition to one that execution units in hardware can interpret. We write tools for network optimizations, write the runtime that schedules and manages the execution on hardware as well as provide guidance for hardware/software co-design of current and future workloads alongside hardware accelerators. The team works cross-functionally with several partner teams inside Apple (such as CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, speech understanding, Camera, Photos, VisionPro) as well as external App-Developers. Core ML is an example of an external facing product from this team. If this role sounds exciting, we want to hear from you!", "description": "Machine Learning and Platforms Technology (MLPT) team is in Apple\u2019s AIML Org.
