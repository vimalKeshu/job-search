{"title": "SoC Power Model Engineer", "summary": "Do you want to utilize your engineering background to make big things happen? Can you influence, connect, get results and communicate effectively? Can you deliver on a predictable and dynamic schedule? Do you have a passion for crafting entirely new solutions? Do you love building without precedent? As part of our Digital Design Engineering group, you\u2019ll take imaginative and revolutionary ideas and determine how to turn them into reality. You and your team will apply engineering fundamentals and start from scratch if needed, bringing visionary ideas to the real world. Your efforts will be groundbreaking, often literally. Join us, and you\u2019ll help design the tools that allow us to bring customers experiences they\u2019ve never before envisioned. You will be part of an exciting silicon design group that is responsible for designing state-of-the-art ASICs. We have an extraordinary opportunity for Power Modeling Engineers. In this highly visible role, you will be responsible for SOC power simulation and power modeling, SOC use case power analysis, and drive the future SOC power optimization.", "description": "Imagine yourself at the center of our SOC design effort, collaborating with all disciplines, playing a strategic role of getting functional products to millions of customers quickly. You will have the opportunity to integrate and come-up with new ideas, as well as work with a team of talented engineers. The main responsibility of this role is to drive the SOC power modeling and optimization for very power efficient products. \u2022 Working with architects to determine the interesting use-cases to simulate; providing power projection for the future projects based on analysis. \u2022 Creating test cases within the design verification team\u2019s environment. Working with design teams to determine the correct functionality or enhance functionality for power reduction. \u2022 Develop IP power model on new architecture design, providing power data for performance/power/area tradeoffs. \u2022 Work cross functional teams, including architecture, RTL and physical design teams, on improving the power efficiency and power efficiency. \u2022 Understand interactions of the product at the software and system level that impact power.", "key_qualifications": "Electrical Engineering background is preferred.
