{"title": "CPU Research Scientist - Platform Architecture", "summary": "Do you have an uncommon desire to seek out and solve exceedingly difficult challenges rather than the easy ones? Do you believe that a world-class team with relentless drive can surpass even their own high expectations? We do! But we also realize this job isn\u2019t for everyone. What we do isn\u2019t easy but you don\u2019t take the easy path. We are seeking a highly motivated, innovative, and confident individual to join the CPU Architecture and Performance Team; we are a group that is driving advanced exploration for next generation iPhone, iPad, and Mac CPU architectures.", "description": "The CPU Platform Architecture team is responsible for setting direction for Apple CPUs towards high performance futuristic micro-architecture ideas. We want to push the boundaries of CPU performance to enhance user experience on Apple products through advanced CPU performance features. In this role you will: -  Solve performance challenges involving branch prediction, data/code pre-fetching, cache hierarchy or other CPU areas. -  Explore the application of state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques and models to solve these CPU performance challenges -  Build the right data analysis tools suited for performance bottleneck identification so that you can parse through the noise and focus on the real problem. -  Conduct continuous research into one or more CPU areas and provide guidance to Apple CPU design team on features that should be implemented in future CPUs. -  Present analysis/findings to CPU architecture and design teams. -  Provide recommendations and influence the roadmap for future Apple CPUs used in iPhone, iPad and Mac systems.", "key_qualifications": "-  Experience and knowledge of CPU architecture and micro-architecture concepts. -  Expertise in one or more CPU focus areas (i.e. branch prediction, pre-fetching) is a plus. -  Knowledge of and experience with machine learning literature, model selection, tuning, and explain-ability. -  Ability to identify performance bottlenecks in common industry workloads, craft ideas to solve them, and implement those ideas in the performance simulator. -  Proficient in C/C++ and Python.", "preferred_qualifications": "", "education_experience": "B.S. and a minimum of 3 years relevant industry experience. PhD in Computer Science or Computer Engineering with focus on Computer Architecture or Machine Learning preferred.", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range. This provides the opportunity to progress as you grow and develop within a role. The base pay range for this role is between $143,100 and $264,200, and your base pay will depend on your skills, qualifications, experience, and location.
