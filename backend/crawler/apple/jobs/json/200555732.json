{"title": "ML Data Program Manager", "summary": "Do you believe Machine Learning and AI can change the world? We do too! Join our Data Team in the System Intelligence and Machine Learning (SIML) group, within Apple\u2019s Software Engineering organization. We build high-quality ML datasets at scale to train models powering AI features across Apple products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods. Our work is behind essential features such as Camera, Text and Handwriting recognition, and Apple Intelligence experiences (Image Playground, Writing Tools, Smart Script, Math Notes\u2026). As SIML is expanding its global presence outside of Silicon Valley, we are looking for a talented individual to drive Data Programs supporting ML models and features developed by R&D teams located in Europe. As our first Data Program Manager in Zurich, you will drive such Data Programs and run the corresponding data projects end-to-end (collection & annotation). AI-centric products are the future of software. At their core, data is the source code of AI, a key component of innovation and inclusive and fair ML products. We invite you to join us at this exciting time! Grow fast and positively impact multiple critical features on your first day at Apple!", "description": "Our SIML Data team focuses on acquiring, synthesizing, annotating, and ensuring the quality of ML data, driving numerous features in collaboration with R&D teams in Apple\u2019s Software organization.
