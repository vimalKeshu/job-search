{"title": "SWE - Vulnerability Researcher, Security Engineering", "summary": "Apple's Security Engineering & Architecture team (SEAR) focus on security needs. Passionate about safeguarding, we believe the best defense is a good offense. When it comes to securing more than a billion devices running the world's most sophisticated operating systems, that means finding vulnerabilities first. Can you make a difference on this scale? Join our extraordinary team of security researchers and discover Apple products' vulnerabilities before they ship.", "description": "Our team focuses on securing low-level technologies such as the iOS and OS X kernel, boot ROMs, firmware and hardware. Working alongside a wide variety of teams and vendors, your influence will be felt throughout Apple's extraordinary products, such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV. Tasked with identifying threats in advance, as well as being directly involved in Apple's response to critical issues as they arise. This includes reverse engineering an exploit, providing insightful analysis, creating innovative tools, consulting with other teams on both hardware and software, auditing code and reviewing designs, the job is as diverse as it is crucial. This position requires someone with strong technical strengths and a passionate desire to secure systems by showing how they can be broken. Day to day you'll cover many areas to help make Apple\u2019s products the industry\u2019s most secure. You'll assist with evaluating security critical code and hardware; building automated tools for vulnerability finding; crafting exploits on discovered vulnerabilities to challenge existing mitigation techniques; providing security design consulting to other teams. Knowledge designing embedded and \u00b5-architecture systems with security in mind on macOS and iOS with some exposure to the kernel is helpful. If this is you, we'd love to hear from you.", "key_qualifications": "Background in secure coding and code auditing. Expert in reverse engineering (IDA Pro, Ghidra, etc.) & developing plug-ins.
