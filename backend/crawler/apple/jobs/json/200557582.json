{"title": "IP Design Engineer", "summary": "Come and join Apple\u2019s growing wireless silicon development team. Our wireless SoC organization is responsible for all aspects of wireless silicon development, emphasizing highly energy-efficient design and new technologies that transform the user experience at the product level. All of this is driven by a world-class vertically integrated engineering team spanning RF/Analog architecture and design, Systems/PHY/MAC architecture and design, VLSI/RTL design and integration, Emulation, Design Verification, Test and Validation, and FW/SW engineering. If you enjoy a fast-paced and challenging environment, collaborate with people across different functional areas, and thrive during crisis times, we encourage you to apply.", "description": "In this role you will work on a small team dedicated to IP architecture, design, and verification. As a member of the team you will be asked to architect and design new modules while working with multiple cross-functional teams including: Design Integration, Platform Architecture, Software Engineering, DFT, and Debug. You will write formal verification to prove the designs (when feasible). All designs will be written in SystemVerilog and will use SV simulations and SVA formal verification environments. You will run quality checkers (lint, CDC, RDC, etc...) and be expected to provide constraints and waivers when necessary. You will be asked to support the DV simulation team and the bring-up teams with the usage of new IP modules. All new designs are required to have documentation, example code (where relevant), and integration notes. Expect to give presentations to cross-functional teams on the new IP designs.", "key_qualifications": " ", "preferred_qualifications": "Fluency in SystemVerilog Assertions\nBackground in low power design\nUnderstanding of embedded software design\nExperience in diagraming architectures and presenting designs to integration / software teams\nWorking knowledge of synthesis and static timing analysis\nComfortable with clock domain crossings as well as CDC/RDC checking tools", "education_experience": "", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range.
