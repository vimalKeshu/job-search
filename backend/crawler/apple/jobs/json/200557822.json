{"title": "Senior GPU Compiler Backend Engineer", "summary": "As a member of the Apple Silicon GPU Compiler Performance Team, you\u2019ll implement improvements to the open-source LLVM mid-level optimizer as well as our LLVM-based machine-dependent code generator for the Apple GPU architecture.", "description": "The Apple GPU architecture is part of the silicon that powers all of Apple's devices. The work we do has a direct impact on the billions of Apple devices shipped to date. We work with many different organizations within Apple \u2013 hardware architecture, silicon engineering, device drivers, application frameworks, and the Xcode developer tools. This kind of collaboration and cross-functional reach allows our team to influence the hardware architecture and software stack. We're part of delivering phenomenal performance, functionality, and robustness for all graphics shaders and compute kernels that run on Apple GPUs. Our team is focused on improving the end-user experience by maximizing the execution speed of the code generated for Apple GPUs while minimizing energy consumption. We are enabling new GPU architectures, technologies, and applications through innovation in compilers.", "key_qualifications": "The ability to communicate clearly and effectively, especially with people less technically proficient in the areas you\u2019ve gained expertise in\nAn inclination toward collaborative approaches to solving complex problems\nExperience writing C++ code in a modern style\nHands-on experience developing LLVM-based compiler backends (e.g. instruction selection, instruction scheduling, register allocation)\nExperience with instruction selection with either LLVM\u2019s SelectionDAG or GlobalISel\nExperience implementing SSA-based optimization passes", "preferred_qualifications": "Experience implementing or improving instruction schedulers and register allocators for CPU or GPU compiler backends\nKnowledge of GPU architectures and how they differ from CPU architectures", "education_experience": "", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "", "company": "apple", "url": "https://jobs.apple.com/en-in/details/200557822"}
