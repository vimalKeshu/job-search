{"title": "Wireless PHY Systems Engineer", "summary": "As a Wireless PHY Systems Engineer, you will be a core member of our highly innovative and visible Wireless System-on-Chip (SoC) design team. What does that mean? You will be help define modem architectures, develop physical-layer algorithms, and invent embedded DSP algorithms for chips enabling exciting new wireless applications! One emphasis of your specific role will be end-to-end simulation of sophisticated systems, modeling components from a multitude of signal processing fields. Including but not limited to propagation channel modeling, RF/antenna abstractions, PHY & MAC protocols and algorithms, and sensor fusion schemes to fuse wireless and non-wireless metrics. Application areas include ultra-wideband sensing and specialized wireless audio; products enabled or enhanced by our team\u2019s SoC\u2019s include specialized audio headsets (such as AirPods) and iPhones!", "description": "You will work closely with other PHY systems and algorithm engineers, analog and digital designers, FW & SW Engineers in the areas above. In order to invent/derive, simulate, implement, verify and test physical layer features, to make new chips and enable a variety of novel applications in the portable & wearable consumer electronics space. As well as collaborate with multi-functional teams to model, simulate, and visualize the performance of complex systems from user movement, wireless propagation models, and RF/antenna behavior, via PHY/MAC protocols and associated signal processing mechanisms, all the way to simulating inertial sensor fusion processing.", "key_qualifications": "", "preferred_qualifications": "Experience with fixed-point design and RTL vector generation is a plus.Experience with handling and processing large amounts of field and simulation data, including user-friendly visualization of complex test setups and simulation results, including measurement accuracies, system latencies, etc.Experience with and/or knowledge of industry standards such as Bluetooth, Ultra-Wideband, GPS, and/or other wireless protocols.Experience in lab FPGA/silicon bring-up, PHY/RF/MAC testing and debugging and usage of lab equipment is preferred.", "education_experience": "", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range. This provides the opportunity to progress as you grow and develop within a role.
