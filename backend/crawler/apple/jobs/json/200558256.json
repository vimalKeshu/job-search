{"title": "Sr. RFIC Design Engineer", "summary": "The Wireless SoC Radio Team architects, designs and delivers state-of-art CMOS radios, from RF-to-bits. As an RFIC design engineer, you will be at the center of this wireless SoC design group. You will have a critical impact on developing Apple\u2019s state-of-the-art radios and getting them into hundreds of millions of products.", "description": "As a RF IC design engineer, you will be a key member of an RFIC team, researching, designing and bringing the next-generation of wireless technologies into high-volume production in advanced CMOS technology nodes. Responsibilities include: - Design of analog and/or RFIC blocks. - Overseeing the layout and verifying the design to ensure a successful tape-out. - Overseeing the test and characterization of the design, and debugging issues that may arise from early development stages through productization. - Working with the system group to define the requirements for RF and baseband blocks based on the system requirements. - Working with the technology team to understand the capabilities and limits of the technology node to achieve the optimum performance.", "key_qualifications": "", "preferred_qualifications": "MSEE and PhD is preferred. RFIC circuit design. Direct tape-out experience with one or more of the following blocks: RF front-end circuits, PA, LNA, mixer, oscillator, PLL, LO, VGA, filter, ADC/DAC, TIA or other baseband analog blocks in deep sub-micron CMOS technology. Deep understanding of analog design concepts such as analysis of noise, linearity, mismatch, stability, and other analog impairments. Deep understanding of CMOS device physics, RF device modeling, device noise parameters, inductor modeling, and circuit layout for optimum RF performance. Familiarity with various RF transceiver architectures and their trade-offs Familiarity with Cadence Virtuoso, Spectre RF, EMX and similar tools. Experience in Si characterization and debug.", "education_experience": "", "additional_requirements": "", "pay_benefits": "At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range. This provides the opportunity to progress as you grow and develop within a role. The base pay range for this role is between $166,600 and $296,300, and your base pay will depend on your skills, qualifications, experience, and location. Apple employees also have the opportunity to become an Apple shareholder through participation in Apple\u2019s discretionary employee stock programs. Apple employees are eligible for discretionary restricted stock unit awards, and can purchase Apple stock at a discount if voluntarily participating in Apple\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase Plan.", "company": "apple", "url": "https://jobs.apple.com/en-in/details/200558256"}
