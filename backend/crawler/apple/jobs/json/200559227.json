{"title": "SoC Memory Performance Engineer - Platform Architecture (m/f/d)", "summary": "Do you love crafting elegant solutions to complex problems? Do you enjoy learning how systems work from the big picture down to the smallest detail? As part of the SoC Performance group, you\u2019ll work with a diverse set of cross-functional teams to help architect, optimize and ship our industry-leading SoCs powering Apple products from iPhone to Apple Watch, iPad, Macs, and more. In this role, you will be a member of the Platform Architecture team, working with hardware and software engineering groups to shape the architecture of Apple's future System-on-Chips (SoC). We are seeking an energetic and highly motivated SoC performance engineer to drive development of our memory system and caches for the next-generation of wearable products like the Vision Pro, and Cellular/5G applications. The position calls for independent performance modeling and simulation, documentation, and collaboration with design/software teams. We are looking for SoC architects with a passion to innovative new hardware concepts and model them in C++/Python to demonstrate their value and impact. This position is available for our sites in Cambridge, St Albans or Munich (Germany).", "description": "You will conduct architectural and micro-architectural feature exploration and validation using the performance model for Apple silicon. You will have responsibilities for developing the SoC hardware solutions that drive the architecture of Apple\u2019s future System-on-Chips. Your work will be highly visible and critical to delivering the best performance and power efficiency in Apple\u2019s future products. You will be expected to collaborate with all the hardware and software teams that are part of Apple\u2019s SoC development. Your responsibilities will include, but are not limited to:  - Create C++ based performance models of proposed architectural solutions and features. - Execute simulation based performance analysis for our products to compare and propose architectural design alternatives. - Defining test plans and test planning methodology to secure the performance targets towards the product. - Gathering, analyzing and validating measured and simulated results to compare architectural design alternatives. - Improve Apple\u2019s modeling platform by developing APIs, tools, and optimal standard examples that can be used throughout the company. - Tuning and validating future SoC HW/SW for the best user experience. - Interface and collaboration with cross-functional teams: architecture, hardware and software teams for collaborative debug, and correlation studies. - Some international travel is required for this position.", "key_qualifications": "", "preferred_qualifications": "Solid knowledge of cache management and memory controller for DRAM technologies.
