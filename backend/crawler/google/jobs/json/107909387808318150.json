That\u2019s why Googlers build products that help create opportunities for everyone, whether down the street or across the globe. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you\u2019ll use your technical expertise to lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects from start to finish. You\u2019ll work with stakeholders to plan requirements, identify risks, manage project schedules, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company. You're equally comfortable explaining your team's analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical tradeoffs in product development with engineers.\n\nOur goal is to build a Google that looks like the world around us \u2014 and we want Googlers to stay and grow when they join us. As part of our efforts to build a Google for everyone, we build diversity, equity, and inclusion into our work and we aim to cultivate a sense of belonging throughout the company.\n\nIn this role, you will require a blend of technical expertise in information security, risk management, and business continuity with stakeholder management and procedural enforcement skills. You will play a critical role in supporting and enhancing Payments risk posture by managing a wide range of privacy, security, compliance, and abuse risks across the product area.\n\nUsers come first at Google. Nowhere is this more important than on our Advertising and Commerce team: we believe that ads and commercial information can be highly useful to our users if that information is relevant to what our users wish to find or do.
