{"title": "Technical Program Manager III, Site Reliability Engineering, Google Cloud", "level": "Mid", "location": "Cambridge, MA, USA", "description": "A problem isn\u2019t truly solved until it\u2019s solved for all. That\u2019s why Googlers build products that help create opportunities for everyone, whether down the street or across the globe. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you\u2019ll use your technical expertise to lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects from start to finish. You\u2019ll work with stakeholders to plan requirements, identify risks, manage project schedules, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company. You're equally comfortable explaining your team's analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical tradeoffs in product development with engineers. Our goal is to build a Google that looks like the world around us \u2014 and we want Googlers to stay and grow when they join us. As part of our efforts to build a Google for everyone, we build diversity, equity, and inclusion into our work and we aim to cultivate a sense of belonging throughout the company. Using your technical and leadership expertise, you run Engineering-focused projects that are well-defined under supervision. The Technical Program Manager (TPM) role within Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is at the heart of fulfilling SRE\u2019s mission: making things faster, more reliable, and preparing for the continued growth of Google's infrastructure. As a TPM, you ensure that systems and services are carefully planned and deployed, taking into account multiple variables such as price, availability and scheduling, while always keeping the bigger picture in mind. You are comfortable driving massive projects which span many teams, have a strong interest in doing the right thing for our users and always think critically and strategically about Google as a business. You are equally at home explaining your analyses and project recommendations to wider audiences as you would be discussing the technical merits of next generation architectures with Google's engineers, or building tools to automate and scale their impact. Google Cloud accelerates every organization\u2019s ability to digitally transform its business and industry. We deliver enterprise-grade solutions that leverage Google\u2019s cutting-edge technology, and tools that help developers build more sustainably.
