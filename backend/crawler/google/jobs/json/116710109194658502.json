{"title": "Software Engineer, Machine Learning Compilers", "level": "Mid", "location": "New Taipei, Banqiao District, New Taipei City, Taiwan", "description": "Google's software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We're looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google\u2019s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward. Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our team combines the best of Google AI, Software, and Hardware to create radically helpful experiences. We research, design, and develop new technologies and hardware to make computing faster, seamless, and more powerful. We aim to make people's lives better through technology.", "key_qualifications": "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience. 2 years of experience with software development in one or more programming languages (e.g., Python, C, C++). Experience with data structures or algorithms.", "preferred_qualifications": "Master\u2019s degree in computer science, or a related technical field. Experience with compilers (e.g., optimization, parallelization, etc.). Experience in Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) or Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM). Experience with compiler development in the context of accelerator-based architectures. Experience in optimizing ML models for inference.", "responsibilities": "Work as part of the EdgeTPU compiler team, analyze and improve the compiler quality and performance on optimization decisions and compilation time. Develop parallelization and scheduling algorithms to optimize compute and data movement costs to execute Machine Learning (ML) workloads on the EdgeTPU. Work with EdgeTPU architects to design future accelerators, the hardware/software interface, and co-optimizations of the next generation EdgeTPU architectures. Work on efficient mapping of Generative AI models and other key workloads into EdgeTPU instructions through the compiler. Collaborate with ML model developers, researchers, and EdgeTPU hardware/software teams to accelerate the transition from research ideas to user experiences.", "company": "google", "url": "https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/jobs/results/116710109194658502"}
