As part of our efforts to build a Google for everyone, we build diversity, equity, and inclusion into our work and we aim to cultivate a sense of belonging throughout the company.\n\nIn this role, you will deliver large-scale, high-value Data Center projects. You will administer and coordinate construction agreements, serving as primary contact between Google and contractor, and coordinate and oversee the extended workforce. You will develop an understanding of the project delivery details, and use experience in the construction space and knowledge of the project to elevate the performance of other project stakeholders through active management.\n\nBehind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google's product portfolio possible.
