{"title": "Application Research Scientist, Quantum AI", "level": "Mid", "location": "Goleta, CA, USA; Los Angeles, CA, USA", "description": "As an organization, Google maintains a portfolio of research projects driven by fundamental research, new product innovation, product contribution and infrastructure goals, while providing individuals and teams the freedom to emphasize specific types of work. As a Research Scientist, you'll setup large-scale tests and deploy promising ideas quickly and broadly, managing deadlines and deliverables while applying the latest theories to develop new and improved products, processes, or technologies. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, our research scientists work on real-world problems that span the breadth of computer science, such as machine (and deep) learning, data mining, natural language processing, hardware and software performance analysis, improving compilers for mobile platforms, as well as core search and much more. As a Research Scientist, you'll also actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing your findings, with ideas inspired by internal projects as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world. Our team's research is focused on development of applications of current and near term quantum computers for problems in the domains of physics, chemistry and material science. Our approach includes a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis with experiments. Examples of recent results include experimental studies of information scrambling in quantum circuits, demonstration of non-Abelian braiding, many-body spectroscopy and topological phases of matter. In this role, you will apply theoretical, many-body physics techniques, to design/optimize protocols for applications. You will be modeling the noise and other sources of error on the device and designing optimal error mitigation and error correction strategies. The full potential of quantum computing will be unlocked with a large-scale computer capable of complex, error-corrected computations. Google Quantum AI's mission is to build this computer and unlock solutions to classically intractable problems. Our roadmap is focused on advancing the capabilities of quantum computing and enabling meaningful applications.", "salary": "$136,000-$200,000 + bonus + equity + benefits", "key_qualifications": "PhD in Physics, Quantum Information Science, a related field, or equivalent practical experience.
