Google User Experience (UX) is made up of multi-disciplinary teams of UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Content Strategists, Program Managers, and Engineers: we care deeply about the people who use our products. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering insights about the attitudes, emotions, needs, and behaviors of people who use our products to inspire and inform design. We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google\u2019s businesses. As a Quantitative User Experience Researcher (Quant UXR), you\u2019ll help inform your team of UXers, product managers, and engineers about user needs. You\u2019ll play a critical role in creating useful, usable, and delightful products. You\u2019ll work with stakeholders across functions and levels and have impact at all stages of product development. You will investigate user behavior and user needs using empirical research methods such as logs analysis, survey research, path modeling, and regression analysis. Quant UXRs vary in background and use skills from computer science, quantitative social science, econometrics, data science, survey research, psychology, human-computer interaction, and other fields. You\u2019ll combine skills in behavioral research design, statistical methods, and general programming to improve user experience. The Quantitative UXR community at Google will help you do your best work. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to work with and learn from UXRs across Google through regular meetups, mentor programs, and access to internal research tools. The Core team builds the technical foundation behind Google\u2019s flagship products.
