{"title": "Systems Development Engineer, OmniLab", "level": "", "location": "Bengaluru, Karnataka, India", "description": "Systems Development Engineering (SDE) at Google is a role where you manage services and systems at scale. SDEs creatively put their engineering discipline to use automating the mundane and reducing toil. We don\u2019t just write code to fix bugs, but emphasize the development of tools and solutions that fix classes of problems. We know it\u2019s hard to control what you can\u2019t measure \u2013 so we focus on observability: instrumenting first, then turning data into knowledge, and finally knowledge into action. We know that the operational efficiency of Google systems, services, virtual compute environments and the operating systems that power them impact the environment, not just the bottom line. We know that working together we can do more, and that community matters. Google brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame-free environment. We promote self-direction to work on meaningful projects, while we also strive to create an environment that provides the support and mentorship needed to learn and grow. Together we engineer and build the infrastructure, tools, access and telemetry for systems that enable orchestration of Google-scale services. Come build things that matter. The Core team builds the technical foundation behind Google\u2019s flagship products. We are owners and advocates for the underlying design elements, developer platforms, product components, and infrastructure at Google. These are the essential building blocks for excellent, safe, and coherent experiences for our users and drive the pace of innovation for every developer. We look across Google\u2019s products to build central solutions, break down technical barriers and strengthen existing systems. As the Core team, we have a mandate and a unique opportunity to impact important technical decisions across the company.", "key_qualifications": "Bachelor's degree in Information Security, Information Systems, Computer Science, Information Technology, a related field, or equivalent practical experience. 2 years of experience with systems automation and working with technical infrastructure (e.g., deployment, maintenance, troubleshooting).
