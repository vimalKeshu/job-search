Manage support services before they go live through activities such as system design consulting, developing software platforms and frameworks, capacity planning, and launch reviews. Provide guidance to other team members on managing availability and performance of mission critical services, on building automation to prevent problem recurrence, and on building automated responses for non-exceptional service conditions. Maintain services once they are live by measuring and monitoring availability, latency, and overall system health. Lead sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems. Scale systems sustainably through mechanisms like automation and evolve systems by driving changes that improve reliability and velocity.", "company": "google", "url": "https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/jobs/results/139545337508307654"}
