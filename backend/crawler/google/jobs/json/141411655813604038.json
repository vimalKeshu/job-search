{"title": "Principal Engineer, Foundations Performance", "level": "Director+", "location": "Sunnyvale, CA, USA", "description": "Core Machine Learning (ML) is the central machine learning platform team that provides ML software tools and hardware infrastructure to all the Google product areas including Search, Ads, Youtube, Google Cloud, Maps, etc. Core ML is focused on Driving ML excellence for Google. Our aim is to simplify and make it easier to perform ML experimentation, development, and productionization. We work closely with Google Research to bring new software and hardware research innovations to market. This enables us to better meet the challenge of the rapidly evolving hardware and software space around ML.  Foundations specifically focuses on enabling users with high performance, scalable, and portable infrastructure for a diverse set of hardware and ML frameworks. As the Principal Engineer, Foundations Performance, you will lead the silicon design and influence the hardware architecture to create the largest scale and most versatile ML systems. You will be a technical lead who works across business units at Google, as well as with Google DeepMind researchers to assess the needs and constraints for very large-scale ML systems, and then translate these insights into a high performance hardware architecture system design. This is a highly impactful and strategic position requiring significant technical expertise in distributed systems, software hardware co-design, and ML accelerators. Google Cloud accelerates every organization\u2019s ability to digitally transform its business and industry. We deliver enterprise-grade solutions that leverage Google\u2019s cutting-edge technology, and tools that help developers build more sustainably.
