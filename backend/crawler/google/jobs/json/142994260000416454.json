You\u2019ll play a critical role in creating useful, usable, and delightful products. You\u2019ll work with stakeholders across functions and levels and have impact at all stages of product development. You will investigate user behavior and user needs using empirical research methods such as logs analysis, survey research, path modeling, and regression analysis. Quant UXRs vary in background using skills from computer science, quantitative social science, econometrics, data science, survey research, psychology, human-computer interaction, and other fields. You\u2019ll combine skills in behavioral research design, statistical methods, and general programming to improve user experience. The Quant UXR community at Google will help you do your best work. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to work with and learn from UXRs across Google through regular meetups, mentor programs, and access to internal research tools.
