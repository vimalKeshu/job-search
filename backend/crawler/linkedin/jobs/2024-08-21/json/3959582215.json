{"jobTitle": "Customer Support Specialist", "company": {"name": "VERO", "location": "United States"}, "location": "United States", "jobType": "Full-time", "employmentType": "Full-time", "experienceLevel": "Not Applicable", "description": "VERO Leasing for the Future | Confidence for Today VERO is a vertical SaaS platform, purpose-built to mitigate risk, increase leasing velocity, and consolidate vendors in the rental real estate workflow. Our cloud-native platform handles everything from applicant pre-qualification through lease execution. VERO\u2019s proprietary technology quickly and accurately verifies financial and personal information critical to risk mitigation and lease execution. VERO creates trust and confidence in the leasing process by empowering property owners and operators to work more efficiently and profitably while simultaneously allowing applicants to maintain control of their own data and financial identity. OUR CORE VALUES Excellence: We are a high-performing team and hold the bar high for ourselves and each other. We take pride in the quality work that we produce and continually iterate to improve. Bias For Action: We optimize for execution, asking ourselves \u201cWhat can we do today?\u201d to make progress towards our goals, always iterating along the way. Passion: We bring energy and enthusiasm to our work and connect our day-to-day activities to our mission so that it is clear to our teammates and customers that we care. Customer Centric: We make every decision, big and small, with the customer in mind. We know we don\u2019t get to be here without them and never lose sight of that in all we do. One Team: We are collaborative, rowing in the same direction toward our common goals. We believe the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and that we win and lose together as one team across all departments. HOW WE MEASURE SUCCESS Our customer-facing teams are dedicated to delivering reliable and effective solutions with a dedication to excellence for both our users (applicants/renters) and our clients (property managers). We take pride in every interaction, ensuring our support exceeds expectations and reflects our commitment to quality and efficiency. KPIs including, but not limited to, Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and First Response Time are used to measure the success and health of our team\u2019s delivery of our mission. LIFE &amp; CULTURE We strive to create a passionate and results-oriented team by fostering a culture of collective achievement, continuous improvement, and passionate service. We believe that by democratizing access to information and instilling a bias towards action, we allow good ideas to percolate from anywhere and avoid siloed thinking. We work fast, hard, and with a focus on providing a world-class experience for our clients. ABOUT THE ROLE The Customer Support team is responsible for supporting both the Renters that are applying through VERO, and the Managers that are reviewing and managing applications and leases in VERO. Our dedicated concierge-level service for strategic clients, VERO1, increases the occupancy rate of our clients by actively engaging with applicants to streamline the process of meeting leasing application requirements. Most of our support is done through chat and email, but we also jump on the phone or a scheduled screen share meeting with users when that is the most effective way to assist. This opportunity is for folks who truly love supporting our strategic customers to achieve their objectives and see themselves in a customer-facing role long-term. This is not a springboard into other areas or jobs at VERO. This is a great role for those who are looking to be a pivotal part of creating customer experience excellence at VERO, helping us innovate through experience as we grow and develop both as an organization and as a team. NOTE: We are currently looking to fill a shift of Tue-Sat 9am to 6pm ET (6am to 3pm PT).
