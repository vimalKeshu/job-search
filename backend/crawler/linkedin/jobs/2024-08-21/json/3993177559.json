Allio\u2019s mission is to transform the way fintech investors approach portfolio management through the lens of a macro system predicated on education and next-level financial technology. By elevating our clients' understanding of the factors that move markets they will learn not just how to interpret economic signals but more importantly, what implications they have for the sectors and industries that make up their portfolio.</strong>\n\n<br/>\n\n<strong>\u00a0\u00a0The world is experiencing a contentious changing global order in the midst of a 4th industrial revolution. High inflation, unrestrained government spending, dedolarization and political polarization create difficult headwinds for the US to continue leading the world in innovation. Innovation is directly correlated with productivity, but productivity is a result of education and a market economy driven by incentives. Academia has become a beacon for Neo-Marxist Ideology. Demands to legislate equality of outcome have replaced the decades long standards of equality of opportunity shrouded in meritocracy. As a result, for the first time in U.S. history, individuals are faced with the likelihood that they will have a lower standard of living than their parents. In order to combat this contagion, it starts with educating professionals on the economic policies that are going to give them and their posterity the best quality of life. Enter macro investing. No matter one's political affiliation, both sides are interested in seeing their investments grow. This creates a catalyst to explain how monetary and fiscal policy directly impact their finances. The goal is to produce an informed, united electorate capable of setting equitable growth policies predicated on data, not ideological party affiliation, leading to higher productivity and an increased standard of living.</strong>\n\n<br/>\n\n<strong>Responsibilities</strong>\nWork directly with C-level leadership on creating a vision and product roadmap beyond our Beta product\nSet product development priorities\nCollaborate across development, operations and marketing teams to communicate a clear North Star vision for the product\nDevelop, monitor, and report on key metrics for success in the Allio launch\nTrack in-App analytics to monitor user behavior and engagement\nEnsure the development team\u2019s work is in line with that strategy, and hitting necessary milestones to launch within the appropriate timeline\n\n<br/>\n\n<strong>Qualifications (Must Have)</strong>\n<strong>Obsessed with the customer, data, and delivering results for clients.</strong>\n<strong>Ability to see the big picture while executing on the small details that matter</strong>\n<strong>4+ years experience working in a project or product management role\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>3+ years experience working with mobile applications</strong>\n<strong>3+ years experience collaborating with and directing technical teams</strong>\n<strong>3+ years of experience working with design to deliver a seamless, positive user experience</strong>\n<strong>2+ years of experience in Product Owner/ Business Analyst Position is a MUST</strong>\n<strong>Strong knowledge and interest in investing, personal finance, and the fintech space</strong>\n<strong>Ability to develop, monitor, and report on metrics across platforms</strong>\n<strong>Working knowledge of SQL for data analytics</strong>\n<strong>Experience working with Mixpanel is a MUST</strong>\n<strong>Experience managing projects in Jira is MUST</strong>\n<strong>Experience with a variety of CMS (headless and non-headless) systems is a MUST</strong>\n<strong>Experience with Figma is a MUST</strong>\n<strong>Experience with conducting customer discovery and focus group tests around UI/UX</strong>\n<strong>Sense of accountability and ownership for product lifecycle</strong>\n\n<br/>\n\n<strong>Preferred</strong>\n2+ years of UI/UX (design)\u00a0\n2+ years of experience with Figma\n2+ years experience working with Fintech applications\nExperience working within highly regulated industries (insurance, pharmaceutical, financial)\nExperience navigating capital markets (Stocks, Options, Forex, Crypto)\nUnderstanding of MacroEconomics", "responsibilities": "Work directly with C-level leadership on creating a vision and product roadmap beyond our Beta product\nSet product development priorities\nCollaborate across development, operations and marketing teams to communicate a clear North Star vision for the product\nDevelop, monitor, and report on key metrics for success in the Allio launch\nTrack in-App analytics to monitor user behavior and engagement\nEnsure the development team\u2019s work is in line with that strategy, and hitting necessary milestones to launch within the appropriate timeline", "qualifications": {"required": "Obsessed with the customer, data, and delivering results for clients.\nAbility to see the big picture while executing on the small details that matter\n4+ years experience working in a project or product management role\u00a0\n3+ years experience working with mobile applications\n3+ years experience collaborating with and directing technical teams\n3+ years of experience working with design to deliver a seamless, positive user experience\n2+ years of experience in Product Owner/ Business Analyst Position is a MUST\nStrong knowledge and interest in investing, personal finance, and the fintech space\nAbility to develop, monitor, and report on metrics across platforms\nWorking knowledge of SQL for data analytics\nExperience working with Mixpanel is a MUST\nExperience managing projects in Jira is MUST\nExperience with a variety of CMS (headless and non-headless) systems is a MUST\nExperience with Figma is a MUST\nExperience with conducting customer discovery and focus group tests around UI/UX\nSense of accountability and ownership for product lifecycle", "preferred": "2+ years of UI/UX (design)\u00a0\n2+ years of experience with Figma\n2+ years experience working with Fintech applications\nExperience working within highly regulated industries (insurance, pharmaceutical, financial)\nExperience navigating capital markets (Stocks, Options, Forex, Crypto)\nUnderstanding of MacroEconomics"}, "skills": ["Product Management", "Financial Technology", "Mobile Applications", "Data Analytics", "SQL", "Mixpanel", "Jira", "CMS", "Figma", "UI/UX", "Fintech", "Investing", "Personal Finance", "MacroEconomics"], "postedDate": "2 weeks ago", "remoteWork": "No", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3993177559"}
