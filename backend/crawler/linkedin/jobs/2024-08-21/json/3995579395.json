Unfortunately, scammers may attempt to impersonate our company to deceive individuals seeking employment. We take this matter seriously and want to ensure your job search with us is free from any fraudulent activity.</p>\n<p>Integra Connect has become aware of recent, fraudulent recruitment activity being conducted by individuals or groups who claim to be third party recruiters and/or points of contact for our Company. Examples include sending candidates a request for personal information, conducting online interviews or meetings, making offers of employment, demanding money for employment related services and activities, or asking the applicant to purchase a laptop or other work-related equipment for the job. The aim of the fraud is to obtain personally identifying information (<em>e.g</em>., identity theft) and/or money. The Company\u2019s name, as well as the names of employees, are used to try to convey authenticity.</p>\n<p>Here are some tips to help you identify and avoid job scams:</p>\n<p>1. Always Check the Source:</p>\n<p>Ensure that the job listing is on our official website or a reputable job board. Our official domain is https://www.integraconnect.com/resources/careers/. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or social media messages offering job opportunities.</p>\n<p>2. Be Wary of Requests for Personal Information:</p>\n<p>We will never request sensitive personal information like your Social Security number, bank details, or payment for onboarding/equipment. If you encounter such requests, it's likely a scam.</p>\n<p>3. Verify Contact Information:</p>\n<p>Check that the contact information provided in the job posting, including email addresses and phone numbers, aligns with our official contact information. Scammers often use generic or non-company email addresses.</p>\n<ul><li>What is the sender\u2019s email address? Is it consistent with other job postings from this company? Email addresses that are slightly different from any business\u2019s primary contact information (Jane.Doe@IntegraConnect.org vs John.Doe@Integra Connect.com) are a common warning sign.</li><li>If you are contacted through LinkedIn, be sure to review the entire profile to verify their credentials.</li></ul>\n<p>If you suspect that a job offer is fraudulent, we recommend that you do not respond to it.</p>\n<p>If you believe you are the victim of any fraudulent activity, you can report it to the appropriate authorities at https://www.myfloridalegal.com/consumer-protection/how-to-protect-yourself-job-listing-and-job-search-firms (Florida Department of State) and/or https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams#report (U.S. Federal Trade Commission).</p>\n<p>Integra Connect is not responsible for any fraudulent offers and advises prospective candidates to follow the guidance provided above.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest in a career with Integra Connect. We look forward to connecting with genuine, talented individuals like you.</p>\n<p></p>", "responsibilities": "The Representative, Customer Care is responsible for handling customer telephone calls, both incoming and out-going as well as communication through fax, email, and mail.
