Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as \u201cSenior\u201d to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. \u201cEngineer, Platform\u201d, \u201cSales, Business Development\u201d or \u201cManager, Talent\u201d). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within One.<br/><br/>Inclusion &amp; Belonging<br/><br/>To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
