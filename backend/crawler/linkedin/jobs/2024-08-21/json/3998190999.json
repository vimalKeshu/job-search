Initially built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic ecosystem, developing unique financial products, including Afterpay/Clearpay, to provide a better way to send, spend, invest, borrow and save to our 47 million monthly active customers. We want to redefine the world\u2019s relationship with money to make it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible.\n\nToday, Cash App has thousands of employees working globally across office and remote locations, with a culture geared toward innovation, collaboration and impact. We\u2019ve been a distributed team since day one, and many of our roles can be done remotely from the countries where Cash App operates. No matter the location, we tailor our experience to ensure our employees are creative, productive, and happy.\n\nCheck out our locations, benefits, and more at cash.app/careers.\n\nJob Description\n\nThe Lending team\u2019s mission is to expand access to credit for the 40M Americans with poor or thin credit. Our customers often only have horrendously predatory credit options available to them (ex. average APR in the payday loan space comes in at :390%). Borrow, our flagship product, is a simple, fair, and accessible micro-credit solution for Cash App customers.\n\nBorrow has grown >74% YoY and is one of our highest searched and asked for products. Borrow customers cite using it for everyday necessities (ex. groceries, gas, bills) when in a pinch. However, we\u2019re just getting started. The majority of our existing Borrowers max out their credit limits, and often reach out asking for an increase in their credit line.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for a gritty, driven Product Manager to own the experience and business metrics for repeat customers on our platform. We have millions of Monthly Actives today (and growing!). This includes:\n\n* Work with a full stack team that includes Machine Learning and Backend engineers, Designers, Data Scientists, Compliance, Product Counsel, and Customer Support\n* Build and integrate Machine Learning solutions to help customers grow their credit limit while managing losses. \n* Partner with Compliance and Legal counterparts to keep us compliant with rules and regulations. \n* Build simple, clear, and delightful customer experiences for Borrowers to grow engagement and reduce support inquiries\n* Work with different product teams to weave Borrow into the broader Cash App ecosystem\n\nQualifications\n\nLike us, you\u2019ll be deeply committed to delivering positive outcomes for users and passionate about shaping the future of Cash App. Additionally, we\u2019re looking for\n\n* 6+ years of product management delivering successful and innovative products and building/driving product roadmaps\n* A \u201cDriver\u201d mindset \u2013 You are biased toward action and get stuff done. No task is too big or too small for you\n* Comfort with ambiguity coupled with the ability to independently solve ambiguous problems\n* A high quality bar \u2013 for your own contributions and those of the people around you\n* Fluency with data \u2013 you\u2019ve worked on ML (or data heavy) products in the past, and are comfortable running A/B tests. You know how to leverage data to make product decisions without getting stuck in analysis paralysis\n* Customer obsession \u2013 The ability to take on complex product challenges and find elegant, simplifying solutions to avoid making them our users and partner\u2019s problems\n\nHighly preferred\n\n* Experience working in a high growth consumer business, whether FinTech or other\n* Experience leading and working with geographically dispersed teams\n\nAdditional Information\n\nBlock takes a market-based approach to pay, and pay may vary depending on your location.
