The fastest, easiest way to start those conversations is through text messages. That\u2019s why we built a simple, scalable platform that makes two-way texting conversations possible for businesses. Our team of extremely talented people designed our Salesmsg app\u2014our all-in-one text messaging and calling platform for sales, marketing and support teams. Salesmsg is also a fast-growing startup. For three years in a row, Inc. Magazine has named Salesmsg one of the fastest growing private companies in America as part of their prestigious Inc. 5000 list. Since we launched, Salesmsg has helped thousands of businesses attract, engage, convert, and care for customers with text messaging. Right now, we\u2019re looking for an experienced, empathetic customer champion to be our next Director of Partnerships. (Could this be you? Keep reading to find out. But first\u2026) Why Salesmsg? We\u2019re a people first company. Easy to say, right? We really mean it. We love hiring remarkable, brilliant-but-humble people who are some of the kindest people you\u2019ll meet. That includes everyone from our two co-founders to our just-started-this-week team members. We ALSO put our customers first. Our ultimate goal is our customers\u2019 success. That goal drives every area of our business from our product team who created 157 new features in 2023 alone to our customer success team who responds to customers in an hour (or less). We\u2019re a remote company. Why bother moving or driving to the office when you can work from home? That\u2019s why our team is spread across the U.S., Europe and Asia (Florida, Minnesota, Georgia, Indiana, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Utah, California, Bosnia Herzegovina, and Belarus). As long as you can show up to work on your computer, we\u2019re happy to have you! We only build exceptional SaaS products. Our worldwide team built our best-in-class platform with simple, scalable features that we improve every single day. We give unlimited time off. We\u2019re a startup, so we want to reward our dedicated employees by giving you real vacation time. That\u2019s why we give unlimited time off, so you can take the time you need. We pile on the benefits. Besides a competitive salary, we offer all the benefits you need to take care of yourself and your family like health, vision and dental. Our Core Values 1. We Figure It Out. We're a startup. Stuff will break and things will not work as you want them to. You will hit barriers and blocks keeping you from getting done what you said you'd do. You are the type of person that 'come hell or high water' will figure it out. This is fun for you. 2. Seek Continuous Improvement. We pursue GREATNESS. There\u2019s a wealth of knowledge in books, articles, videos, courses, training events, and everywhere you look. Just Google it. If you can\u2019t \u201cfigure it out\u201d yourself, trust me, someone else already has for you. We're resourceful and go deep to learn the best strategies. 3. Keep it Real &amp; Conversational. Seeing things for \u201chow they truly are\u201d gives us power. In fact, we have be real in order to survive and thrive. We have to speak truthfully and honestly because if we don't things go unsaid, animosity stirs, and resentment takes over. It's debilitating for high performance teams to win. Speak truthfully and keep it real. Call it like it is. Provide solutions, not problems. 4. People First Mindset. As we seek to constantly improve we realize that the best answers to many of the opportunities to grow, products to create, and partnerships to solidify come from our customers. Helping the customer achieve success is our ultimate goal and through that we find new ways to make our product and team better. 5. Be Flexible. The road is never straight and there will be twists and turns and bumps and stops. We all need to row in the same direction to work together and get things done. Don't make it harder than it has to be. If it takes a few minutes, hook a brother up. Don't battle. We win together, not apart.
