We\u2019re on the search for a Store Manager that will be at the forefront of bringing the fandom to life. You\u2019ll lead the store in achieving store objectives with regard to hitting sales targets, recruiting, development, and performance management. You\u2019ll be a retail maverick that can handle anything that comes your way. You\u2019ll be a believer in developing talent and providing the best customer service in the mall. In short, you\u2019re a superhero.", "responsibilities": "Ensure that your store achieves the sales plan and/or comp sales goals. It\u2019s not all about the Benjamins, but then it kind of is. Recruit, develop, and retain a super collaborative and passionate team to run your store alongside you. You\u2019re the leader of the band, and you love to create buzz and customer engagement through staying connected on social media, store web applications, and clienteling. Lead an operationally sound business; you\u2019ll bring the right balance of organizational structure, delegation & autonomy, and customer first selling practices. Keep watch (like the Night\u2019s Watch) on shrink/loss prevention, payroll hours, schedules, and external factors that will affect business. Collaboratively communicate with retail leadership and HQ partners on trends & customer feedback. Run sales reports and use data to help guide your strategy to hit sales targets.

You\u2019re willing to adapt to new technologies, communicate company policies & procedures, and control supply ownership (spending only as needed). Deliver the goods - you\u2019ll merchandise the store in a compelling way, leveraging planograms as a guide, while launching all promos on time. Every Fellowship needs a Gandalf!

You'll have to be at least 18 years of age to join the fandom force. A high school diploma or GED equivalent. If you have a degree, even better. Roll with the punches! Retail is a fast-changing industry and you like catching curveballs thrown your way. Open-minded and inquisitive regarding pop culture fandoms & trends. The usual retail stuff (with or without reasonable accommodation): able to navigate your way around the store, merchandise product utilizing approved store equipment, and pack and unpack boxes of awesome merch that may weigh up to 50 pounds.", "preferred": ""}, "skills": [], "postedDate": "1 year ago", "applicationDeadline": "", "benefits": "", "remoteWork": "Not specified", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3574813747"}
