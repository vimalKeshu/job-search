That's us. That's Baskin-Robbins. Over 70 years ago, Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins had the crazy idea of offering 31 flavors of ice cream when everyone else was still selling vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. Burt and Irv were absolutely nuts about ice cream (Irv even had a swimming pool shaped like an ice cream cone). Their passion was contagious, and we like to think our 1300+ flavors have made the world a more flavorful place since we opened for business in 1945.", "postedDate": "11 months ago", "skills": ["Attention to detail", "Time management", "Cleanliness", "Creativity", "Ability to multitask", "Ability to work in a team environment"], "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3739000881"}
