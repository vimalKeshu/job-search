We have grown fast, but aim to retain our scrappy nature that enabled us to build big AI models that outperform the industry standards. There are many companies right now that talk about the potential impact of AI while we hustle hard and have actually proven the benefits repeatedly.<br/><br/><strong>Helpful<br/><br/></strong>We help people become smarter by using AI or data generated by AI models - the increased human intelligence is driven via a polished AI product that makes sense of noisy social media data, documents, web data, podcasts, internal or external communications. IV.AI takes problems that were previously too complex to manage because of the scope of the research and tracking needed to solve them and makes them easy to solve via high-quality data, easy to use tools and experienced, helpful teams.<br/><br/><strong>Inclusive<br/><br/></strong>Our inclusive culture values people regardless of their background, education or upbringing. In order to train machines to act appropriately, we need builders and contributors who are representative of the entire population. AI is only as good as the teams working on it and the training they receive. AI is incredibly powerful and human bias in the training process can be equally harmful to the world if the technology is not being managed by teams of people who are diverse and considerate.<br/><br/><strong>Hardworking<br/><br/></strong>In just 5 years IV.AI has built a scalable platform with 100s of AI solutions for Fortune 500 companies including Sony, Walmart, Toyota, Netflix, Time Warner, Fox, Capital One, Est\u00e9e Lauder, to name a few.<br/><br/><strong>Professional<br/><br/></strong>Being professional and respectful of clients and coworkers is of the utmost importance.
