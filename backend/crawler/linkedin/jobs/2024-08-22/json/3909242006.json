We take this mission seriously, and we aspire to become the premiere communicator of stories of life change and transformation in American youth ministry.<br/><br/>We\u2019ve got amazing stories to tell, but we need help telling them. That\u2019s where you come in.<br/><br/>Key Responsibilities:<br/><br/>This role will help accomplish our vision by telling stories to mobilize our current and future partners to deeper involvement in the mission to reach this generation.<br/><br/>Our Communications Coordinator will play a part in driving forward powerful communication with our ministry partners through weekly newsletters, major fundraising campaigns, and ongoing social media engagement. You will work on a team of staff, interns, and volunteers, going out into the field to observe what the Lord is doing in and through our team. Ultimately, you will spend a lot of time writing (so we hope you love it). You will interview, tease out details of stories, fact check, and record the narrative of the work the Lord is accomplishing through our mission.<br/><br/>Some specific things this job includes:<br/><br/><ul><li>Compose or empower others to write our \u201cStory of the Month\u201d newsletter</li><li>Create drip campaigns to engage our various ministry audiences (potential hires, donors, volunteers, parents, pastors, educators, and etc.)</li><li>Ghost write major funding and cultivation pieces for ministry executives</li><li>Participate in weekly team meetings, lead trainings for interns and volunteers as needed, and meet one-on-one with the Marketing Director</li><li>Produce press releases as needed</li><li>Give input to ministry communication priorities and strategy</li><li>Oversee production schedules for print, mail, and digital publication deadlines</li><li>Go into the field to collect photos and stories. Often this will be at local schools and events, and at other times this means traveling with our team to various mission trips</li><li>Help develop the ministry podcast<br/><br/></li></ul>You\u2019ll report to the Marketing Director and work collaboratively within the Marketing Team. The idea of working with a loose team of interns, volunteers, and free-lancers should sound fun and energizing to you.

And we think that\u2019s a really good thing!<br/><br/>Just like missionaries about to be sent across the world, your first assignment on Decision Point staff will be to personally contact churches, friends and family and gather a team of partners to monthly invest in the ministry that God is leading you into. We\u2019ll give you tons of training, encouragement and ongoing coaching. If you like everything else and feel like this could be a good fit for you, do not let fundraising stop you; let\u2019s talk first.<br/><br/>Will you come help save the next generation?<br/><br/>You may still have a lot of questions. You may still be praying about whether God is calling you to this mission. That\u2019s ok! Let\u2019s talk.
