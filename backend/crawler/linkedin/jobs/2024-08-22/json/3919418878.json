We are dedicated to reducing the impact of the fashion industry on the planet by being green 365 days per year. When you support resale, you\u2019re not just being good on your wallet - you\u2019re giving back to the environment and contributing to an economy that is sustainable and green.<br/><br/>Since 2015, Uptown Cheapskate has joined forces with Kid to Kid and buildOn across the nation to raise money to build schools in developing countries. With the support of tens of thousands of customers all across the nation, we\u2019ve far surpassed our initial goal and have raised over $600,000 and funded 18 schools (and counting!).
