We are looking for friendly, highly motivated people to join our crew of Fashion Consultants.<br/><br/>Uptown Cheapskate is an exciting retail store concept that sells quality clothing brands at affordable prices. Every month, our franchise stores buy and resell thousands of clothing items that have been gently used at a fraction of the prices originally charged. That\u2019s why Uptown Cheapskate is such an effective idea that resonates with customers of every income bracket and style persuasion. Our stores feel more like a boutique than a thrift shop, allowing more people to feel comfortable shopping second-hand.<br/><br/>At Uptown Cheapskate, we have a passion for sustainable fashion. We are dedicated to reducing the impact of the fashion industry on the planet by being green 365 days per year. When you support resale, you\u2019re not just being good on your wallet - you\u2019re giving back to the environment and contributing to an economy that is sustainable and green.<br/><br/>Since 2015, Uptown Cheapskate has joined forces with Kid to Kid and buildOn across the nation to raise money to build schools in developing countries. With the support of tens of thousands of customers all across the nation, we\u2019ve far surpassed our initial goal and have raised over $600,000 and funded 18 schools (and counting!). With your help, communities in Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Haiti, Nepal, Malawi, and Nicaragua now have the facilities that they need to educate their children for years to come.<br/><br/><em>This franchise is independently owned and operated by a franchisee.
