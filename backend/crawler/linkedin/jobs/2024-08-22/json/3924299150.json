And I think we need to talk further about that possibility.<br/><br/>Here's my quick background, and I hope that you can see that if being part of this industry and team can do this for me, it can do it for you too.<br/><br/>I moved to Los Angeles out of college way back when to pursue a career in music. It was a wild ride and I did a lot of amazing things, but I eventually hit a point where I was seeing the writing all over the wall. I was getting older and just wasn\u2019t making enough money. In desperate need in of finding something new, I found a craigslist ad in 2019 and got my life insurance license. It was on a whim, and I had no idea what I was getting into, but it has completely transformed my life! It took me a moment to find my footing but once I did, there was no turning back.<br/><br/>The beautiful thing about the insurance industry is that it allows for a flexible work schedule and it allows a person to make as much money as they would like. Provided they are willing to work hard to get it, the sky is truly the limit here.<br/><br/>I went from knowing literally nothing about insurance, to working from home and bringing in <strong>$20K per month!<br/><br/></strong>Again, this takes VERY hard work, but it\u2019s super possible. If I can do it <strong>SO CAN YOU!!<br/><br/></strong>With quality leads to call and incredible mentorship and training, this system is proven to work.. as long as you work it.<br/><br/>I've had the opportunity to travel internationally on ALL EXPENSE PAID trips, made $1000's in bonuses, given myself multiple raises, and now am building a team of amazing agents that I'm teaching and training to do the same! And I hope you are the next person to join!<br/><br/>You\u2019ve heard the old saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not WHAT you know, it\u2019s WHO you know.\u201d Deep down inside you\u2019ve known there was something better for you. You\u2019ve just been waiting to get connected to the right people.<br/><br/>Maybe you\u2019ve been burned and you\u2019re skeptical like I was. I get it. But don\u2019t let past failures or disappointments keep you from your greatest breakthrough. If you're the person who is feeling something inside as you read this ad, you're the person we've been looking for. Come join our team and find your home.<br/><br/>Let's talk!<br/><br/><ul><li>Beau<br/><br/></li></ul>Powered by JazzHR", "postedDate": "3 months ago", "skills": [], "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3924299150"}
