We need materials like cement, steel, and aluminum more than ever to rebuild our bridges and roads, construct wind and solar projects, and manufacture electric vehicles and heat pumps that will undergird our future. But industry needs a second revolution. For as much as industry made the middle class and ushered in a remarkable era of prosperity for many, it also threatens our climate, reinforces environmental racism, wastes valuable materials and energy, and leaves communities and workers behind.\n\nAt Industrious Labs, our mission is to set into motion unstoppable policies, people power, and analysis to make a triple impact on climate, justice, and jobs that drastically reduce dangerous emissions, make industry accountable to communities and workers, and develop a circular economy.\n\nAbout the Position\n\nGuided by an inspiring vision, strategic plan, and significant early financial investment, we are seeking an entrepreneurial Senior Campaign Analyst to join our team. Industrious Labs is fully remote, but for this position, there is a preference for a candidate living in or able to travel to California. This role reports to Partner and Analytics Director Victoria Chu.\n\nIndustrious Labs is poised to kick off a new Clean Heat initiative, with an initial focus on California and a parallel national effort. Working collaboratively with partners over the past year, we have identified an exciting strategy to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dangerous air pollution from industrial heaters and boilers. Today, these heaters and boilers burn fossil fuels to produce needed heat for industrial processes, but in many cases, this equipment can be replaced with all-electric or other zero-emission alternatives. We have received sufficient early-stage backing to begin campaign implementation thanks to a visionary funder.\n\nIn this newly created position, the Senior Campaign Analyst is responsible for designing and leading research, data, and analytic work supporting the Clean Heat initiative. The Senior Campaign Analyst builds and interprets climate and energy models, communicates analysis in technical comments, memos, reports, and visualizations, and leads on data hunting, transformation, and management. Because industrial heat is a new area of advocacy, the Senior Campaign Analyst will often need to create new research methodologies or extrapolate and infer insights from limited or seemingly inapplicable and disjointed data sets. The Senior Campaign Analyst is energized by the challenge of the climate crisis, inspired to step into a new era of the movement, and has a strong track record of working with diverse groups such as organized labor, environmental justice advocates, and policymakers.\n\nAlong with this role, Industrious Labs is currently hiring a Senior Campaign Strategist and Senior Field Strategist for the Clean Heat initiative. The Senior Campaign Analyst will work within this new, dynamic team. Our high-level objectives for the campaign include (but are not limited to):\n\n<ul><li>Accelerate zero-emission state policies and regulations that clean up and transform industrial facilities;</li><li>Launch a coalition focused on industrial electrification to build power and pressure on policy-makers; and </li><li>Increase the urgency for policy-makers to act by building awareness of the harms created by fossil combustion at industrial facilities and the benefits of transformation.<br/><br/></li></ul>The Senior Campaign Analyst holds key responsibilities that will evolve over time as the team grows and functions are distributed. During the first year of the role, the Senior Campaign Analyst will advance:\n\n<em>Technical Analysis</em>\n\n<ul><li>Lead technical industrial analysis, publishing technical reports and presenting findings for non-technical audiences.</li><li>Contribute expert testimony, analysis, and comments to push and support regulatory processes that are already underway, such as through the South Coast Air Quality Management District's regulation of boilers and process heaters.</li><li>Oversee and contribute to the development of a techno-economic boilers and process heater inventory supplemented by existing or emerging decarbonization technologies</li><li>Work with the rest of the Clean Heat initiative team to develop materials for regular publication.<br/><br/></li></ul><em>Strategic Impact</em>\n\n<ul><li>Measure, track, and report the impact of the Clean Heat initiative within the framework of Industrious Labs' Impact Measurement system and toward the overall goal of heavy industrial decarbonization.</li><li>Become an in-house subject matter expert on decarbonization pathways for industrial process heat.</li><li>Lead in the design and implementation of analytical and quantitative tools in partnership with campaign and field leads for the development of robust, data-driven campaigns.<br/><br/></li></ul><em>Organizational and Partner Support</em>\n\n<ul><li>Conduct analyses and foster equitable data approaches to deliver greater benefits to historically marginalized and frontline communities, supporting efforts to reduce exposure to negative health and environmental impacts from heavy industry.</li><li>Build and maintain relationships with advocates, community leaders, environmental and energy justice organizations, and industry experts to exchange information, advance shared objectives, and engage in collaborative projects.</li><li>Communicate analysis to internal stakeholders, funders, and coalition partners in the form of webinars, trainings, articles, or reports to accelerate progress and learning in needed areas.<br/><br/></li></ul>Who You Are\n\nThe incoming Senior Campaign Analyst is driven by their belief and commitment to Industrious Labs' vision, mission, and values. Through their track record and expertise \u2013 optimally within the climate or another social justice movement \u2013 the successful candidate will play a vital role in the development and execution of a burgeoning Clean Heat initiative.\n\nThe Senior Campaign Analyst brings an energy systems background and analysis to the team to identify and support strategic climate opportunities, including research and analysis of energy, climate, industry, and electoral/socio-political trends. The Senior Campaign Analyst has a clear understanding of\u2014and a deep commitment to\u2014people and communities that are most impacted by climate change and industrial pollution.
