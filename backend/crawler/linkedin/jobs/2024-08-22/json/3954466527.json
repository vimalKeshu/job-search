We\u2019re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they\u2019re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That\u2019s us.\n\nThere are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We\u2019re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.\n\nWho You Are\n\nYou\u2019ve got positive energy. You\u2019re optimistic about the future and determined to get there. \nYou\u2019re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0. \nYou appreciate direct communication. You\u2019re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let\u2019s face it, you can\u2019t have one without the other. You\u2019re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.\nYou can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too.

Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn\u2019t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.\nYou want to be part of a winning team. We\u2019re stronger together, and you\u2019re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.\n\nData Science is an integral component of Coinbase\u2019s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users.
