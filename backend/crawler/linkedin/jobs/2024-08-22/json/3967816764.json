Chipotle has always done things differently, both in and out of our restaurants. We are changing the face of fast food, starting conversations, and directly supporting efforts to shift the future of farming and food. We hope you will join us as we continue to learn, evolve, and shape what comes next on our mission to make better food accessible to everyone.\n\nTHE OPPORTUNITY\nAt Chipotle, we've created a better place to eat and work. Many employees start just expecting a paycheck but end up with a rewarding career. We provide exceptional training and a clear career path - over 80% of our managers were promoted from Crew. We prepare real food by hand every day in our restaurants. No freezers, microwaves or can openers to be found. We'll provide the training you need to feel confident working at any station - grill, cashier, prep, salsa and expo. We take pride in our exceptional customer service and it's up to each of our team members to create the friendly atmosphere that our customers expect and enjoy. So, whether you have experience as a dishwasher, cashier, server, host, bartender, cook, prep cook or no experience at all, we're always looking for passionate and enthusiastic people to join our team. If this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, we'd love to meet you!
