An opportunity lies in Research to work across divisions and departments to create a unified language that ensures that internal clients understand\u2014and take advantage of\u2014complex metrics. The key is giving the necessary context so that decisions can be made. While this sounds disarmingly simple, it is a challenge to get the majority of the company to speak the same language and understand new vernacular. Research is a central force within the broader organization in gaining an objective perspective for a wide array of complex questions. It may sound academic \u2013 and certainly there is a portion of the job that requires a love of learning \u2013 but the primary attribute that will bring you success is curiosity. For example, you\u2019ll gain a deeper understanding of what motivates someone to tune into a show, buy a product based on placement of an ad, become a fan on social media, or why certain types of programs are successful across regions of this country and abroad. Ultimately, each research candidate gets a better understanding of the rigor that goes into making business decisions by uncovering not boulders, but pebbles along the path to connecting to A+E Networks core asset, its content.<br/><br/><strong>Compensation<br/><br/></strong>Annual Pay Range: $121,750 - $140,012<br/><br/>Annual Incentive Target: 10.00%<br/><br/><em>The annual/hourly</em> <em>pay range displayed serves as a</em><em> good faith estimate of</em><em> the <br/><br/></em><em>minimum and </em><em>maximum </em><em>base </em><em>pay </em><em>range </em><em>for this role. </em><em>Compensation for the role</em><em> will <br/><br/></em><em>be based on </em><em>a </em><em>number of different </em><em>factors such as </em><em>a candidate\u2019s qualifications, skills, <br/><br/></em><em>competencies, </em><em>location, and </em><em>experience. </em><em>A+E offers a competitive total compensation <br/><br/></em><em>package, which </em><em>includes healthcare coverage, 401k matching, and a range of other benefits. </em><em>Learn more at aenetworks.com/careers.<br/><br/></em><em>A+E Networks proudly provides equal employment opportunity for all employees and job applicants, and makes employment decisions consistent with this principle.
