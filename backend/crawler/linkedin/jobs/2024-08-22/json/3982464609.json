Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.<br/><br/><strong>The Role<br/><br/></strong>Netflix is building a new internal game studio to incubate and build games to maximize the player value of the Netflix Games platform. This role will be a key owner for a variety of initiatives and projects from production to business operations - we\u2019ll work together to generate a backlog and tackle them in priority order. You will report to the Director of Development for Internal Studios and work closely with the Internal Studios program management team to execute priority initiatives on behalf of Internal Studios. This may include deep dives on specific studios or products or portfolio-wide initiatives. An example of a key initiative will be producing prototypes using pieces of technology within the Netflix ecosystem to deliver novel experiences for players, which can then be leveraged for game teams. The successful candidate will have experience managing or leading multiple products through their full lifecycle - from ideation to live service, and have a history of successfully delivering games with a focus on player value with teams of varying sizes. They will have a deep stack of \u2018seen that, done that,\u2019 and be able to bring a deep toolkit of solutions yet retain the flexibility to tailor solutions to the team\u2019s requirements. You\u2019ll be joining a leadership team who aspires to create ideal conditions for game developers to do their best work, and work with leaders to prioritize and execute on key projects. The Internal Studios group is a small, scrappy team with big ambitions, and an obsession to create memorable game moments that leave players telling their own stories for years to come. We\u2019re looking for strong allies who care deeply about the experiences they create - those who bias towards action and are energized by the learning that comes with bold experimentation at an agile pace. As a part of Netflix, we strive to hire the best and value integrity, excellence, respect, inclusion, and collaboration. Now is an amazing time to join Netflix Game Studio as we seek to entertain our hundreds of millions of members in a really new way. Responsibilities<br/><br/><ul><li>Deliver - As part of the Internal Studios production team, this role will be accountable for building and executing a program for the production and delivery of experimental (pilot) projects that are outside the scope of other game teams.</li><li>Execute - Gather requirements, understand constraints, define acceptance criteria and be able to deliver a credible execution plan and deliver value against priority problems. Especially valuable is a desire to deliver \u2018slices\u2019 of incremental value to iterate and take on feedback. (This role will have a large number of ad-hoc projects, and will require the successful candidate to take an ill-defined problem space, define it better, come up with a plan for victory for alignment and then execute.)<br/><br/></li></ul>Requirements Ideal requirements Location Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses.
