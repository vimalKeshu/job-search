We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We\u2019re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.\u202f<br/><br/>We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.\u202f<br/><br/>To learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.<br/><br/>By providing your information, you acknowledge that you have read our Applicant Privacy Notice and authorize Roku to process your data subject to those terms.<br/><br/>", "responsibilities": "Act as the day-to-day partner relationship manager to grow partners within Roku Channel\nDrive communication, education, data management across managed partners\nSupport the onboarding of new content partners\nCoordinate the submission, selection and launch of new partner content, communicating with partners and working internally with Programming, Acquisition and Operational teams \nCreate and present performance evaluations for partners, including comprehensive quarterly business reviews\nDevelop internal partner playbooks that offer executive staff a concise overview of partnerships along with actionable strategic plans\nBuild deep partner expertise, developing strong internal and external workflows to provide best-in-class service to partners\nLeverage data, market research and insights to evaluate new content partnership opportunities to Roku Channel\nLean into other content partnership areas as needed \nCollaborate with content acquisition, content operations, editorial, and marketing on deal lifecycle and execution through partner roll out\nAssist in the development and implementation of marketing and editorial strategies that maximize user engagement\nWork with product and analytics teams to drive automation, enhanced reporting and tools to improve the efficiency of strategic plans\nAggregate feedback flagged internal and external stakeholders into comprehensive and actionable trackers to drive process improvement\nPerform other tasks, projects, and responsibilities as assigned by leadership", "qualifications": {"required": "5-7 years of relevant experience in a top management consulting firm, investment bank and/or media/entertainment/tech company in a strategy, program planning or analytical role\nExperience delivering results in consultative, partnerships, and/or business development environments\nStrong analytical skills including creating / managing financial and operational KPIs (preferably candidates that have worked in a highly-demanding environment where complex analysis is performed)\nExperience conducting quantitative (including modeling) &amp; qualitative analysis to drive results leveraging data comprehension of video streaming business models (MVPD, TVE, SVOD, AVOD, TVOD)\nAbility to cultivate and build strong relationships with content partners and industry counterparts\nBachelor's degree in business, finance, accounting, or economics, or equivalent; MBA preferred but not required", "preferred": "Familiarity with Airtable, Confluence, Salesforce and Looker tooling a plus"}, "skills": ["Airtable", "Confluence", "Salesforce", "Looker", "Partner Management", "Content Programming", "Product Management", "Marketing", "Data Analysis", "Business Development", "Financial Analysis", "Strategic Planning", "Relationship Building", "Communication", "Data Driven", "Video Streaming", "MVPD", "TVE", "SVOD", "AVOD", "TVOD"], "postedDate": "3 hours ago", "benefits": "Roku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families.
