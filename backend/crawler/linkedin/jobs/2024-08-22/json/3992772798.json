We believe that the best story you can make and share is the one of your own life, and we are passionate about designing pieces that reflect and celebrate it.</p><p>From the beginning, our founder &amp; creative director Paige Adams-Geller embraced every moment, aiming to inspire and empower as her story evolved. Her journey began in Los Angeles, where her entrepreneurial spirit took her from working as one of the top fit models in the industry to launching her namesake collection in 2004. Today, she sits at the helm of PAIGE as the only female founder in the denim industry, continuing to challenge convention and infuse her colorful spirit and chic sensibility to every collection she designs.</p><p><br/></p><p>Our brand first launched in February 2005 in high-end retailers including Intermix, Ron Herman, Bergdorf Goodman and Harvey Nichols. Paige's designs became an instant obsession of consumers, celebrities, and prominent fashion editors. Quickly, we unveiled our men's, petites and maternity ranges - all created with the same commitment to the craft.</p><p><br/></p><p>As our story continues to evolve, we remain devoted to the details. We only partner with the best wash-houses in the country, which happen to be in our hometown of Los Angeles. Every style we create is wear-tested, and tested again. We are completely obsessed with designing pieces you'll live in-jeans that go from morning to moonlight; the perfect pair that works like a charm, always; pieces to help you stand tall in what you're wearing, and take you exactly where you want to go.</p><p></p>", "responsibilities": "The goal of this role is to anticipate, mitigate, and navigate obstacles, maintain clear internal communication across all related teams company-wide, and keep all teams moving forward on schedule and on budget.
