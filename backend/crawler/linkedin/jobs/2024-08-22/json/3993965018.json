Every year, the legal system has made it difficult for millions of ordinary people to seek justice, especially for folks without means or who come from underrepresented backgrounds. Our vision is to help these injury victims get the justice they deserve, irrespective of their income, demographics, or the quality of their legal representation.<br/><br/>EvenUp operates across a variety of personal injury cases, including motor vehicle accidents and negligence claims. Our ML-driven software empowers attorneys to accurately assess the value of these cases by doing a core part of their workflow (legal drafting), enabling them to secure larger settlements in record time. As EvenUp evaluates more cases, our proprietary data grows, enhancing the precision of our predictions and delivering more value to both attorneys and victims alike.<br/><br/>We are one of the fastest growing startups ($0 to $10M in ARR in &lt;2 years) and are funded by some of the best investors in the world, including Signalfire, Bain, and Bessemer, who led our recent $50M Series B.<br/><br/>", "postedDate": "2 weeks ago", "benefits": "Choice of medical, dental, and vision insurance plans for you and your family, Flexible paid time off and 10+ holidays per year, A stipend to upgrade your home office for fully-remote roles, 401k for US-based employees", "skills": ["Sales Development", "SaaS", "CRM", "Communication", "Interpersonal Skills"], "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3993965018"}
