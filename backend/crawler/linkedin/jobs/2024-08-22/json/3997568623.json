Anchored in our belief that traditionally under-represented students belong in STEM, we prepare STEM role models to educate and inspire students who lack equitable access to a high-quality science, technology, engineering, and math education.\n\nEnCorps connects highly effective STEM educators with public school students to counter the systemic injustice preventing children in under-resourced communities from accessing a high-quality STEM education. The EnCorps STEMx Tutors Program matches middle school students, currently under-performing in math, with volunteer STEM professionals, subject-matter experts and STEM college students to increase math skills and confidence prior to students entering high school.\n\n<br/>\n\n**Position Summary: **\n\nReporting to and in partnership with the STEMx Tutor Program Manager, the STEMx Program Coordinator (referred to as Program Coordinator moving forward in this document) will provide essential support to EnCorps\u2019 mission to support and mentor the best and brightest science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals as an innovative, long-term solution to the shortage of high-quality, impactful educators for underrepresented students in high-needs communities.\n\nEnduring STEM achievement, access, and literacy gaps disproportionately limit low-income, under-resourced, and minority student opportunities. STEM professionals, when thoroughly prepared, are uniquely positioned to meaningfully utilize their talent and real-world expertise as EnCorps STEM Teachers to deliver an authentic, rigorous, and relevant STEM education to students who need it most.\n\nThe Program Coordinator is a part-time (20 hours/week) position **located in Los Angeles**. The Program Coordinator will serve as a point of contact for STEMx tutors as they volunteer to tutor students with the EnCorps program. The Program Coordinator will assist in the onboarding and management of STEMx tutors\u2019 experiences, as well as provide coaching and mentoring as they tutor students at a partner school.\n\nThe STEMx Program Manager will support the program coordinator at every step and be in frequent contact. The Program Coordinator will benefit from having tools and protocols developed in-house that shape and guide all aspects of a STEMx tutor\u2019s experience and will have the opportunity to provide feedback to improve these tools and protocols.\n\n<br/>\n\n**Position Start Date: **October 1, 2024\n\n**Location: **Hybrid remote <u>(</u>**<u>must reside in Los Angeles</u>**<u>)</u>\n\n<br/>\n\n**Benefits of Working at EnCorps: **\n\nBe part of a hard-working and entrepreneurial culture with fun and passionate people where your ideas and opinions matter!\n\n\u25cf Work from home and create your own flexible PDT daytime hours;\n\n\u25cf Mileage reimbursement;\n\n\u25cf Room for position to grow into full-time\n\n\u25cf $27 hourly/20 hours a week, depending on experience;\n\n\u25cf 1.5 weeks and US national holidays paid time off;\n\n<br/>\n\n**Essential Functions (specific responsibilities will include, but are not limited to): **\n\n\u25cf Coordinate, organize, and oversee the daily operations of the tutoring program;\n\n\u25cf Meet weekly with the STEMx Program Manager;\n\n\u25cf Monitor the work of tutors by reviewing tutor feedback weekly and provide feedback on tutoring/teaching methods and techniques;\n\n\u25cf Assist in the screening and onboarding process for potential tutors in the STEMx program;\n\n\u25cf Work in collaboration with the school site coordinator of each partner school to successfully match students to EnCorps STEMx tutors;\n\n\u25cf Serve as liaison between tutors and school site coordinators in the training of tutors on the school\u2019s math curriculum and online learning platform;\n\n\u25cf Work with the school site coordinator and STEMx Program Manager in conducting periodic reviews of the tutoring program and professional development provided;\n\n\u25cf With the help of the school site coordinator, investigate any concerns expressed by either tutors or students and resolve or refer the matter to EnCorps\u2019 STEMx Program Manager if warranted;\n\n\u25cf <u>Periodically visit school sites and tutoring programs in the Los Angeles area;</u>\n\n\u25cf Meet with the school site coordinator at least twice monthly to solicit input for continual improvement of the tutoring program and services provided;\n\n\u25cf Review and respond to all requests from EnCorps tutors for assistance;\n\n\u25cf Update and maintain tutoring database on a regular basis;\n\n\u25cf Collaborate with STEMx Program Manager to host monthly tutor events, trainings, and workshops;\n\n\u25cf Assess, gather evidence, analyze data, and use reports to improve the effectiveness of the tutoring program;\n\n\u25cf Complete other duties as assigned by the STEMx Program Manager.\n\n<br/>\n\n**Accountabilities: **\n\n\u25cf Collaborate within and across departments to create and support a culture of continuous improvement, collaboration, teamwork, and empowerment;\n\n\u25cf Provide excellent customer service to internal and external constituents;\n\n\u25cf Ensure timely communication with tutors, staff, and partners;\n\n\u25cf Maintain current knowledge of all EnCorps STEMx tutor programming;\n\n\u25cf Represent a positive and professional image of EnCorps;\n\n\u25cf Understand and comply with the policies and practices outlined in EnCorps Staff Handbook.\n\n<br/>\n\n**Qualifications: **\n\nWe are seeking candidates who believe deeply in our organization's mission, who thrive in an entrepreneurial and dynamic environment, and who have a record of successfully coaching teachers, interns, or student teachers.\n\n**Note that <u>middle or high school teaching experience is necessary for this role,</u> ** and experience as an instructional coach, school administrator, field supervisor, or teacher leader is preferred.
