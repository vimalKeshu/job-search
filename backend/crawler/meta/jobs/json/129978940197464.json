{"title": "Engineering Manager, Computer Vision -  Zurich", "level": "", "location": "Zurich, Switzerland", "description": "The Reality Labs (RL) organization at Meta is helping people around the world come together and connect through world-class Augmented and Virtual reality (AR/VR) products. With global departments dedicated to research and development in computer vision, machine learning, haptics, social interaction, and more, RL is committed to driving the state of the art forward through relentless innovation. The potential to change the world is immense - and we\u2019re just getting started.\n\nAugmented and Virtual reality will transform the way people come together to work and play. By developing new hardware and software products capable of understanding human appearance, movement and expression, we aim to make it possible for people to feel like they are directly in front of each other, despite being separated by vast distances. By developing new products capable of understanding the human environments, we will enable a metaverse where people can share virtual experiences which interact seamlessly with the real world.\n\nOur XR Tech organization in Zurich is focused on research and development of machine perception technologies from early concepts to production level across all of Meta\u2019s RL products and surfaces including AR/VR products and Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp). We develop core capabilities across a range of product domains including mixed reality, scene and object understanding, world-scale mapping, avatars, AR/VR remote presence / calling, digital fashion, AR Sharing, and more.\n\nYour job will be to both manage and partner with groups working across the full spectrum from research to product development, managing our technical investment portfolio supporting Tracking and SLAM for AR/VR products across different timelines. You will oversee and be responsible for a broad array of state-of-the-art technology areas and product integrations.
