{"title": "Research Scientist, Neuromotor Interfaces", "level": "", "location": "Burlingame, CA | New York, NY", "description": "Reality Labs at Meta is seeking Research Scientists with experience in product-focused machine learning and signal processing research to advance our pioneering work in neuromotor interfaces, which has grown out of the acquisition of CTRL-labs. We\u2019re building a practical interface drawing on the rich neuromotor signals that can be measured non-invasively via surface electromyography (EMG) with single motor neuron resolution. This technology could become one of the main pillars for interaction with virtual and augmented worlds.\n\nWe are a multi-disciplinary team of researchers investigating the nature of human neuromotor signals, developing novel signal processing and machine learning methods to infer a user\u2019s intent, and creating novel interaction techniques and user experiences. Help us unleash human potential by removing the bottlenecks between user intent and action.", "salary": "US$143,000/year to US$208,000/year + bonus + equity + benefits", "key_qualifications": "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, relevant technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
