{"title": "Hardware Test Engineer, Verification", "level": "", "location": "Zurich, Switzerland", "description": "The Hardware Test Engineer for Verification applies the highest level of skill and knowledge of computer vision, sensor fusion and robotics domains in designing, developing and deploying full end-to-end tracking verification solutions for Meta Reality Labs AR/VR products. You will drive conceptual hardware design with internal and external cross-functional partners early in the product exploration phase and validate the first article in the lab or onsite. You will lead the end-to-end development of software and hardware integration with first-party or third-party partners, which includes verification software pipeline, instrument control, robotic/motion platform control, data capture and process, as well as integration of advanced algorithms. You will lead documenting and troubleshooting station hardware and software issues on test systems and bridge to the production. You will drive the development and deployment of hardware test systems with manufacturing partners and third-party integrators. You will be heavily involved in troubleshooting software issues on test equipment and automation systems. You will help define overall product test strategy, evaluate test equipment and qualification processes, and lead and facilitate integration of test systems into our existing data tracking networks and factory control systems. You will be designing and documenting new manufacturing equipment with standardization and reliability as a priority and creating test plans for validating existing equipment. The ideal candidate will be a self-driven individual working in a cross-functional team environment and be responsible to lead the design, development, and implementation of factory test/calibration systems. You will have the opportunity to work with top-tier product designers, electrical engineers and computer vision scientists on cutting-edge AR/VR technologies. You will enforce and ensure that manufacturability, testability and cost-effective solutions are implemented to deliver top quality tracking system calibrations. This position will be responsible for both NTI and NPI developments and bridge to sustaining support of mass production. You must be responsive, flexible, and able to succeed within open collaborations. You must have a productive mindset and can apply your expertise to solve problems in creative and insightful ways in a very fast paced environment.", "salary": "", "key_qualifications": "Bachelor\u2019s degree in Mechatronics, Automation, Robotics or equivalent with 1+ years of experience in developing test solutions in a consumer electronics or related field.
