{"title": "Research Scientist, Demography and Survey Science", "level": "", "location": "Menlo Park, CA | Seattle, WA | New York, NY", "description": "The Demography and Survey Science team's mission is to improve the way we make decisions and measure impact both within and outside of Meta. We collect and analyze rich survey and behavioral datasets to understand new challenges, solve problems, and shape decisions. We are looking for quantitative social scientists with experience answering complex research questions to join us in this effort.\n\nOur interdisciplinary team includes those with expertise in statistical inference, survey methodology, causal inference and econometrics, regression modeling, exploratory data analysis, and mathematical demography, among other areas. In this role, you\u2019ll own research end-to-end. This means you\u2019ll navigate trade-offs while designing projects, proposing appropriate methodologies, analyzing data, and communicating results to diverse audiences in order to drive impactful decisions.\n\nStrong candidates may include social scientists, applied statisticians, or other applied researchers with expertise in quantitative research methods, experience working with large datasets and relational databases, and experience with survey methodology (e.g., bias correction, sampling). We are looking for candidates who can demonstrate methodological rigor, strong communication skills, and the ability to make research design choices that balance competing tradeoffs effectively.", "salary": "US$109,000/year to US$171,000/year + bonus + equity + benefits", "key_qualifications": "Bachelor's, Master\u2019s, or PhD in social sciences (e.g., Economics, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology, Communication), or in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Informatics, Econometrics) with experience answering social questions.
