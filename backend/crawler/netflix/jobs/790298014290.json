Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><b>The Role</b></p><p>Roles on the team provide an opportunity to explore the unique UI systems architecture challenges presented by the Netflix UI application stacks - balancing the performance constraints of the devices we support with developer-friendly solutions which scale.<br /><br />This particular role requires <b>knowledge of both iOS and Android stacks</b>. We\u2019re looking for <b>expertise in one of them (either one)</b>, to provide technical leadership on that platform. <b>Along with competency in the other</b>. Allowing you to work on implementation across both stacks as project needs arise, while identifying opportunities for leverage across stacks.</p><p><br />We believe strong engineering aptitude transcends stacks, and the opportunity to explore other platforms is a unique aspect of this role.</p><p><br />We\u2019re currently building solutions with Swift on iOS, Kotlin on Android, and TypeScript/JavaScript and React on TV &amp; Web. We use GraphQL as our shared data access technology.</p><p><br />We provide ergonomic solutions for UI engineers to access data, configure applications, create server-driven UIs and optimize performance. We work on client side and server side solutions - wherever a problem takes us. And that\u2019s just scratching the surface.</p><p><br />Many of the projects we take on are broad cross-functional efforts, allowing you to extend beyond our team and engage with teams across the company. We\u2019re a team of peers. Everyone has the opportunity to scope, architect, implement, and support the solutions we deliver.</p><p></p><p><b>The Team</b><br />The Shared Client Foundations team builds shared UI architecture and frameworks which power the Netflix TV, iOS, Android and Web applications on devices ranging from web browsers, mobile phones and tablets, to streaming sticks, cable boxes, Smart TVs and game consoles.</p><p><br />We\u2019re passionate about creating elegantly designed, highly performant UI architectures which empower engineers to build amazing UI experiences used by millions of users across the globe. We partner closely with teams across Netflix to help us deliver solutions which make UI development efficient and enjoyable.</p><p><br />Diverse and inclusive teams are strong teams. We encourage those with varied identities, backgrounds, and experiences to apply. We believe that creating a sense of belonging allows us to be our best selves, which in turn helps us produce our best work. We rely on our unique individual strengths to help each other grow.</p><p><br />We have a distributed team, with some teammates working remotely, and some located in the Los Gatos, CA office. The team is committed to being \u2018remote-inclusive\u2019 and believe it\u2019s about the work you do, and the relationships you build. Where you can best do that from is up to you.</p><p><br />Some of the things we\u2019re excited to be working on currently:</p><ul><li>Building the ideal cross-platform data access architecture for Netflix applications</li><li>Creating a Server Driven UI architecture which accelerates app experimentation</li><li>Delivering frameworks to optimize feature-flag based UI development</li></ul><p><br /><b>You</b><br />People who do well on the team are self-motivated engineers with a passion for driving technology innovation rooted in business and customer needs. Great analytical and technical skills form a solid foundation. But more importantly, we look for engineers who understand that there are rarely any absolutes when it comes to technology. The ability to engage in meaningful discussions about use cases, prioritization and technical challenges with colleagues, while thoughtfully weighing trade-offs across multiple solutions is a skill we value highly.</p><p><br />All of this, so that Netflix members can immerse themselves in the stories they care about, on the devices they love, from whichever part of the world they call home. Without the technology behind it all ever getting in the way.</p><p></p><p>If this resonates with you, we\u2019d love to talk!</p><p></p><p><b>What\u2019s Different About Us</b></p><p><b>Scale, Impact</b></p><ul><li><b>Hundreds of Engineers: </b>You\u2019ll be improving UI development velocity for over 100 engineers.</li><li><b>Millions of Users:</b> creating best-in-class streaming UIs used by over 100M users.</li><li><b>Thousands of Devices</b>: across a wide spectrum of devices.</li><li><b>Globally</b>: in almost every country in the world.</li></ul><p></p><p>\u200b<b>Unique Technical Challenges</b>: We build framework solutions which are flexible enough to withstand the span of use cases introduced by rapid A/B test development, across a varied client, server and network performance landscape, all while being ergonomic to use for the engineers we support.</p><p></p><p><b>Collaboration and Communication</b>: It\u2019s not all about the tech.
