Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nContent Infrastructure & Solutions (CIS) empowers engineers working on content and studio applications to be innovative and agile in supporting our massive global content production needs. We do that by providing scalable and resilient infrastructure to address integrated large-scale media, assets, data, workflow, and communication use cases. Examples of this organization\u2019s work include massive-scale media processing platforms (1, 2), workflows (conductor), and data processing at scale.\n\nThe Content MiddleWare Infrastructure team(MWI), a part of the Content Infrastructure & Solutions group, provides Studio and Content Engineering specific, highly leveraged, and fully managed data, workflow, and messaging & communication platforms facilitating the goal of the Connected Studio. To learn more about what the MWI team does, check out the following tech blogs: workflow (1, 2), search (1, 2, 3), data movement (1, 2).\n\nThe Media Infrastructure Platform team (MIP) is part of a media-focused engineering group that provides highly available infrastructure for content production and processing, storage, and access, across all Netflix productions and licensed content. Infrastructure pieces like massive-scale media processing platforms (1, 2), and media storage infrastructure (1, 2)\u00a0 are key systems we build. All of this is custom-built on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.\nWe are hiring managers in PL to build and lead either of the following teams: <ul><li><b>MWI Data Search Team: </b>This team will own Graph Search (<a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-content-engineering-makes-a-federated-graph-searchable-5c0c1c7d7eaf\" class=\"postings-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-content-engineering-makes-a-federated-graph-searchable-part-2-49348511c06c\" class=\"postings-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/reverse-searching-netflixs-federated-graph-222ac5d23576\" class=\"postings-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3</a>), a Search-as-a-Service platform, within the MWI Data team.
