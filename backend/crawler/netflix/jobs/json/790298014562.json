Members can watch or play as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen.\u00a0\n\nMachine Learning/Artificial Intelligence powers all of our consumer experience, including content discovery and personalization, identifying and attracting new members to our product, optimizing our payment processing, and much more.\u00a0\n\nMore recently, fast-paced innovation in large language models (LLMs) has greatly helped advance state-of-the-art technology in many areas of personalization, including search and recommendation experiences.\u00a0\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nThe Consumer ML Serving team provides the computational platform on which we build nearly all our consumer-facing ML/AI applications. If you\u2019ve seen it, we probably served it! We provide all the building blocks to serve ML at scale, including a real-time model serving platform, an event-driven model and feature compute framework, a distributed compute orchestration engine, and more. Additionally, as we expand to enable LLM innovation in numerous areas of personalization, we\u2019re building model serving infrastructure for LLMs and other large foundation models.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe are looking for a strong senior engineer to own and develop our long-term vision. Our systems power some of Netflix's most business-critical models, and we need you to take our ML/AI initiatives to the next level. You will play a highly cross-functional role, partnering with other engineers, product managers, machine learning engineers, and data/research scientists.\u00a0\n\nIf you have a passion for building scalable, robust systems, are interested in pushing the envelope in applied ML algorithms, and enjoy seeing a direct line between your work and what our customers see on their screens, we want to talk to you.\u00a0\n\n\nYou may enjoy working with us if you are: <ul><li>Self-driven and highly motivated to deliver top-tier ML infrastructure while navigating highly ambiguous environments and can execute 0-to-1 projects.&nbsp;</li><li>Eager to learn about new domains and ship high-quality, well-tested code.</li><li>Able to produce generic and optimal solutions while balancing near-term needs.</li><li>Excited to work in a multidisciplinary environment (engineering, algorithms, data engineering/science, and product experimentation).</li><li>Comfortable working in a hybrid team with partners distributed across (US) geographies & time zones.</li><li>Willing to take broad ownership of team responsibilities (building roadmaps, scoping, task breakdowns, etc.)&nbsp;</li></ul> We would especially love to work with you if have experience with: <ul><li>Building and operating high-traffic, real-time distributed systems and ML serving infrastructure for LLMs and other large foundation models.</li><li>Supporting large-scale ML models with a direct impact on what customers see.&nbsp;</li><li>Translating the requirements of research scientists into generic platform offerings.&nbsp;</li><li>Delivering systems requiring high availability, throughput, and performance.</li><li>Navigating highly ambiguous environments.&nbsp;</li><li>Taking on and executing zero-to-one projects.</li><li>Leading projects with 3-4 other engineers.</li><li>Building applications in an object-oriented programming language.
